You will be given two files. One file is the original file and the other file is the edit made by the user. Your task is to review the edit and apply it to the original file as the final file that need to be saved.

The content of the original file is:

```{{original_extension}}:{{original_path}}
{{original_content}}
```


The content of the new edition file is:
```{{edit_extension}}:{{edit_path}}
{{edit_content}}

```


Notes:
- Specify the path along with the file name in a markdown code block. You can include the full path after the language identifier. Here's the format:

```language:path/to/filename
code goes here
```
- The final file is the file that will be excuted, it is very important that you write all the content in the final file, this is your main task.
