Here are some simple tips for sprinkling non-verbal action tags (e.g. [laughs], [coughs]) into your dialogue or prose:

1. Use sparingly  
   • One or two per scene is usually enough.  
   • Don’t let tags crowd the flow—use them to punctuate key moments.  

2. Keep the form consistent  
   • Always bracket the action: `[laughs]`, `[sighs]`, `[coughs]`.  
   • Use present-tense, third-person singular verbs.  

3. Place tags for clarity  
   • Insert immediately before or after dialogue to cue tone:  
     – “Well, that was… surprising,” she says [laughs].  
     – [coughs] “Excuse me—could you repeat that?”  
   • If a tag interrupts a long sentence, set it off with commas.  

4. Let tags enhance emotion, not replace description  
   • Use them alongside—or instead of—adverbs sparingly.  
   • Don’t write `[laughs]` every time a character chuckles; reserve it for when the laugh itself matters.  

5. Match tag choice to the moment  
   • `[clears throat]` before something awkward.  
   • `[shrugs]` to show indifference.
   • `[eyes widen]` when surprised.

6. Read it out loud  
   • Tags should feel natural in speech.  
   • If it sounds stilted, trim or rephrase.  

Examples in context:  
  • “I won the race,” he says [grins].  
  • [sighs] “I really didn’t want to do that.”  
  • “Trust me,” she whispers [lowers voice].
