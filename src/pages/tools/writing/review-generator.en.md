# AI Review Generator

The AI Review Generator is designed to help you save time when typing reviews. It uses AI to do this by analyzing the keywords you enter and generating a review based on that keywords. The algorithm will generate a review for any product or service that you enter.

## How It Works:

1. Enter product name or service name
2. Enter a minimum of 5 keywords that describe the product or service
3. Click "Generate" button
4. Generated review will be displayed in a text field below.

Once you have generated a review, you will be able to copy and past it directly to your blog, website, Amazon listing, or anywhere else where you need reviews!

### Example:

#### User inputs:

> The Cheesecake Factory
> keywords: great service, wonderful food, tasty cheesecake, positive review

#### Review outputs:

The Cheesecake Factory is a great place to go for a meal. The service is wonderful and the food is tasty. I especially enjoyed the cheesecake. It was very creamy and delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others.
