# AI-generated Summary Generator


> Maila AI > AI Writing Aids > Automatic generation of summaries


## Automatic generation of summaries


Maila AI is a tool that allows you to automatically generate summaries of articles, blog posts, and other texts. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify the most important sentences in a text and then rearranges them to create a summary.


The summaries generated by Maila AI are not just shorter versions of the original text; they are actually new texts that convey the most important information from the original. This makes Maila AI an invaluable tool for busy people who need to get the gist of a text quickly, or for anyone who needs to generate a summary of a text for any purpose.


Maila AI is also useful for content creators who want to ensure that their readers are getting the most important information from their texts.
