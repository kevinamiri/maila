  - Legal Obligation: When Processing is required to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as maintaining financial records for bookkeeping purposes.

- Data Retention: We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by law. The specific retention periods may vary depending on the type of data and the purpose of Processing. Once the retention period expires, we will securely delete or anonymize your Personal Data.

- **Objection**: You have the right to object to the Processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interests (or those of a third party).
