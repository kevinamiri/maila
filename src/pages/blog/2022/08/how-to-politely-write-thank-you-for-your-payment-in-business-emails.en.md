# 4 way to politely say thank you for your payment in business emails.

## 1. Accept our thanks for your recent remittance

### Meaning: 

- Accept our thanks for your recent payment
- Thank you for sending us your payment

### When to use: 

- Use this phrase when writing to thank someone for a payment they made.
- To express gratitude for a payment to repay a debt

### Example: 

- *Thank you again and please accept our thanks for your recent remittance.*
- *We would like to take this opportunity to thank you in advance for your cooperation and to also accept our thanks for your recent remittance.*
- *We are looking forward to making a clean sweep of our debts and hope that this may be the beginning of a new era of prosperity. Accept our thanks for your recent remittance.*
- *After seven months, in the depths of winter, the payment of the first month's rent came. He received it with polite thanks, and the next day, having obtained a bill of exchange for the amount, departed for another town. The remittance reached him at Moscow, and coming on top of all his previous privations, was almost enough to kill him. In a sort of woman's way he immediately, instead of keeping the money for his journey, set off to the shops to buy boots and clothes for his boy—though he would have found it hard to say what the child really needed.*


### Email Example: 


*Dear colleagues,*

*I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their hard work. The company has recently received a large surge of new funds and this could not have happened without the work of all the employees.*

*We would like to take this opportunity to thank you in advance for your cooperation and to also accept our thanks for your recent remittance.*

*Sincerely,*

*[Your name]*
