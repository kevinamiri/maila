# Call invitation email.

A call invite email is an email that is sent to a potential customer or client in order to invite them to a phone call. This type of email is typically used in order to set up a meeting or consultation, and it usually includes the date, time, and purpose of the call.

Once you have this information, you can begin to write your email.

To start, you will need to introduce yourself and explain why the person you are inviting should join your call. Next, you will need to provide the date and time of the call, as well as the phone number of the person you are inviting. Finally, you will need to ask the person to please join your call.

To end your email, you will need to thank the person for their time and add your contact information.
