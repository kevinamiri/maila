They make the process of freelancing easier for both client and consultant by developing efficient and easy to use SaaS platforms which are all entirely based on Cloud and integrated into multiple different environments.
    Each service has its own SaaS platform which does something different. One service is time sheet services to help consultants to efficiently log their time sheets to their clients. This platform logs all time and evaluates how much a consultant is invoicing and then allowed the company to view and monitor these time sheets in an easy way.
    Another service is payroll and helping companies and consultants to correctly manage their payments. From a freelance perspective it means the consultant knows exactly what they are being paid and allows the companies to easily figure out how much they are paying their consultants.
    Lastly their is a service aimed at helping match consultants to assignments. Companies can log their requirements on the platform from tech to the aim of a project and this will then match with available consultants who are able and skilled to work on that assignment making the entire process much more efficient and beneficial to both parties.

There is also a small element of front end development ensuring that the back end not only works to an extremely high standard but also that customers can view their information in an eye friendly and easy manor.
    The experience we are looking for is:
   
     Strong background in back end development with 3 years' experience.
     A core focus on Microsoft development tools (.NET/C#) with .NET Core being a huge benefit.
     Cloud exposure with Microsoft Azure being high priority.
     REST API development experience OR experience integrating systems.
     Any Front end experience with React OR Angular would be beneficial.
   
    
    
   For your work you will receive:
   
     Huge impact on the direction of projects and use of technology.

Om oss

Vi bildade Timeplan 2006 för att underlätta personalhanteringen och arbetslivet för svenska företag och dess medarbetare. Vi erbjuder idag en komplett molnbaserad lösning för schemaläggning, tid och lön. Vi tar nu nästa steg och går mot fler länder och behöver då fler produktutvecklare som gillar att hitta innovativa lösningar på roliga och utmanande problem.
Vi skapar ett stort värde för våra kunder då vi dagligen hjälper tiotusentals medarbetare att få bättre kontroll på vardagen genom att förenkla tillgången till sitt schema och i och med det slippa stressen med att inte veta vilken lön som väntar eller om ens löneuträkningen stämmer. Vi underlättar också i själva tidrapporteringsprocessen.
Vi är idag 15 medarbetare och sitter på ett modernt kontor i centrala Gårda i Göteborg med ca 20 kvm per anställd och med flera tysta rum. Vi har gemensamma fikor, vi har ibland AWs då vi spelar vi brädspel och på fredagar står företaget för padel för den som är intresserad.
Vi har flexibel arbetstid som innebär att du väljer själv när du vill börja/sluta under dagen.
 På grund av covid-19 jobbar alla medarbetare någon/några dagar hemifrån varje vecka för att dels minimera smittspridning dels att fortfarande behålla den sociala delen i sitt arbetet.

Ditt jobb som utvecklare på Timeplan..

Vi jobbar med den senaste tekniken t.ex React, Webpack, TypeScript och C#.
Alla avdelningar samarbetar och hjälper varandra, och mer specifikt hjälper alla på utvecklingsavdelningen varandra genom att ha regelbundna code reviews och vi har även dedikerade testare.
Hos oss är det högt i tak, uppmuntrar kreativa lösningar och vill att alla är med och påverkar det vi skapar dagligen.
Med en back-end byggd på ASP.NET Core och en front-end som använder sig av TypeScript i kombination med React arbetar vi för att ligga i teknisk framkant. Vi driftar vår lösning i molntjänsten Azure.
Vi jobbar med ett agilt arbetssätt och levererar en ny version varannan vecka.

Dessutom kommer arbetsuppgifterna innefatta nyutveckling och underhåll av IT-system som stödjer alla verksamheter vid KI biobank, kundinteraktion samt integration och utveckling av applikationer gällande provdata och andra relaterade medicinska datatyper. KI biobank påbörjar nu ett spännande projekt där en helt ny infrastruktur innehållande många nya applikationer planeras.

Arbetsuppgifter
Fullstackutvecklare till Expressen & Lifestylegruppen

Vill du jobba i ett tvärfunktionellt självstyrande team med moderna tekniker och användaren i fokus? Brinner du för att utveckla produkter som når ut till nästan hela Sveriges befolkning?
På produktutvecklingsavdelningen Expressen & Lifestylegruppen får du jobba med de välkända varumärkena Damernas Värld, Amelia, Sköna Hem, Allt om Mat, Expressen och många fler.
Vilka är Expressen & Lifestylegruppen?

Vår techstack är föränderlig, där vi väljer verktyg och programmeringsspråk efter vad som är bäst för produkterna och teamen. Vi tror att beslut ska fattas så nära de som ska utföra besluten som möjligt. Därför värderar vi självorganiserande team, transparens och stöttande/coachande ledarskap. Just nu jobbar vi framförallt med Node.js och Vanilla Javascript.
Vad kan vi erbjuda dig?

På Expressen & Lifestylegruppen får du jobba nära engagerade och kompetenta kollegor som är stolta över att jobba med Sveriges största journalistiska varumärken vilka alla spelar en viktig roll för demokratin i Sverige. Som utvecklare hos oss kommer du att ingå i ett tvärfunktionellt team som jobbar autonomt med att utveckla sin produkt. Vi jobbar gärna med par- och mobbprogrammering, och med effektdriven utveckling nära användarna. Teamen arbetar agilt och testdrivet med releaser flera gånger varje dag. Våra team inkluderar ett infrastruktur-team, två sajtplattforms-team, ett läsarintäkter-team och ett app-team. Våra team jobbar nära varandra och vi uppmuntrar rotation mellan teamen för att få ökad kunskapsspridning och för att ge våra utvecklare möjligheten att utvecklas och testa på olika saker.
Relevanta tekniker hos oss:

Node.js
React
Javascript
Salesforce/Apex

...men vi är övertygade om att det kan komma att förändras i framtiden, och hoppas att du är med i att hjälpa oss utforska morgondagens tekniker.

Tjänsten är placerad i Bonnier News lokaler på Kungsholmen.

Vem är du?

Vi söker dig som är en erfaren webbutvecklare med djup kunskap och passion för mjukvaruutveckling. Vi ser gärna att du har erfarenhet av Node.js och starka Javascriptkunskaper. Du är prestigelös, gillar att jobba i team för att lösa problem tillsammans i en agil miljö där du och dina teamkollegor själva tar ansvar och driver utvecklingen av er produkt.

Det är meriterande om du har erfarenhet från mediebranschen sedan tidigare. Men kanske har du jobbat med något helt annat som vi kan lära oss av?

Backend Developer,Juniqx AB,411 03 Göteborg,"Do you like the long-term perspective and the common focus of a product company? Are you looking for awesome colleagues, a central office and the opportunity to be involved and build something new from scratch?
Our customer is now looking for consultants who can work as a Backend Developer for the team that builds the next generation of the customer's cloud service.
Job description
As a developer in the backend crew, you will work with the development of the next generation of the customer's platform, which is being built from the ground up. You will work in small dynamic teams where all the skills to achieve jointly set goals are gathered. The team has a great mandate to make technical decisions and drives their own work forward.
Examples of what you could work with:
Implement authentication, throttling, etc. for their API.
Build on their low code language and its compiler.
Develop the building blocks of life cycle management for low code applications.
Optimize database queries to handle complex data flows.
Mandatory skills
Kotlin / Scala / F / other functional programming
JVM
”Good to have” skills
Ktor
SQL (preferably PostgreSQL)
Docker
React
Typescript
Cypress
”Bonus” skills
Kubernetes
Python
Personal
We believe that you have a few years' experience of system development, preferably from a product company.
If you have a good understanding of the JVM, it is a plus and if you have experience of Kotlin and functional programming then we will be even happier, but the most important thing is that you have a genuine interest in programming and enjoy developing and learning new things. .
As a person, you are a team player who thrives in a helpful and supportive work environment.
You are used to taking responsibility and driving the work forward together with your team.
As they build from scratch and are in an expansive phase, it is important that you thrive in a changing environment and enjoy getting to grips with tricky problems.
Technology stack
The customer's backend is written in Kotlin, runs on the JVM and stores data in PostgreSQL.
Other technologies that you will come in contact with are Kubernetes and Docker which their platform runs on and React and Typescript which their front end is built in. Here it is also of course good with a good understanding, but it is not something you will work with every day.
They try to avoid complicating things unnecessarily and want the code to be easy to understand and maintain. To make it easier to do the right thing, they always do code review and have many types of automatic tests and static code analysis.
What does the customer do
The customer develops a cloud service, a low-code platform to be able to deliver tailored, process-based applications to its customers, primarily in Retail and Manufacturing. In the platform, they develop smart tools to quickly and securely build these applications, such as graphical modeling tools, code editors and validations. Customers then use their applications to e.g. coordinate employees, business systems and suppliers in their order-to-delivery process, but it can also be simpler applications such as expense registration or purchase inquiries.

Vår teknikfilosofi är att använda rätt verktyg till det utmaningen kräver. Därför är vi inte rädda att både testa och utvärdera nya tekniker, samt att implementera dessa i skarpa projekt. Vi undviker att välja verktyg enbart på popularitet eller gammal vana.
Det som är viktigt för oss är inte att du är fullärd på allt du gör, utan att du har en positiv attityd och ett intresse för att lära dig nya saker.

"Backend/Data Engineer, Data and Metrics",Spotify,StockholmTillfälligt på distans,"Engineering
Data
The Data & Metrics team within the Financial Engineering mission builds data products and platforms that influence the future path of the Finance organization and Spotify as a company. You'll be working on a vast data ecosystem that drives Spotify’s revenue recognition from subscriptions and ads, forecasting algorithms and financial performance measurement and analysis. You will have a direct impact on the future of Spotify’s global business and product decisions!
Location
Stockholm
Job type
Permanent
We are looking for a Backend Engineer with data pipelines experience for our team! We are developing an internal system for uncovering patterns in the company metrics, as a part of the Financial Performance Management platform. Our mission is to lower the time between a new trend emerging in the metrics and the company being aware of the change.
You will join an experienced team that spans the full range of a distributed system: frontend and backend engineers, but also data engineers and scientists! Your role will be to develop the backend that exposes the results of detection to frontend clients, and as such we need you to be proficient in modern backend technologies, as well as understanding the specific needs of a system that interfaces towards data pipelines and statistical models.

What you’ll do
Develop backend services in Java that expose data both in relational and non-relational databases to a React frontend.
Design the interaction between the backend databases and the data pipelines that apply statistical models, answering questions like which type of store is better suited for which results, how to scale out to larger work loads, or how to update to schemas in the future
Continue the design of the API exposed to clients: extend for new metrics and insight types, accommodate breaking changes
Deploy and operate the backend services that you develop on Google’s GCP cloud.
Who you are
BS or MS in Computer Science or relevant work experience.
2+ years developing backend services, using Spring Boot or similar frameworks. Having used Spotify’s own Apollo framework is a plus but is not required.
You have either worked directly with distributed processing frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Beam … or have worked on a backend system that interacted meaningfully with such a framework.
We expect a reasonable familiarity with current practices of software development: design via RFCs, testing and continuous integration, DevOps
Where you’ll be working
We have a distributed team that is near the CET timezone (Stockholm). Near means 1 hour more or one hour less than this timezone and you can choose from one of our EMEA locations.
If you prefer to work from an office, we can arrange a spot in one of our physical offices. There is usually one in every country where Spotify operates. Otherwise, you can choose to work from home or from a co-working space.
Our global benefits
Extensive learning opportunities, through our dedicated team, GreenHouse.
Flexible share incentives letting you choose how you share in our success.
Global parental leave, six months off - fully paid - for all new parents.
All The Feels, our employee assistance program and self-care hub.
Flexible public holidays, swap days off according to your values and beliefs.
Spotify On Tour, join your colleagues on trips to industry festivals and events.
Learn about life at Spotify
Spotify is an equal opportunity employer. You are welcome at Spotify for who you are, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or what’s playing in your headphones. Our platform is for everyone, and so is our workplace. The more voices we have represented and amplified in our business, the more we will all thrive, contribute, and be forward-thinking! So bring us your personal experience, your perspectives, and your background. It’s in our differences that we will find the power to keep revolutionizing the way the world listens.
Spotify transformed music listening forever when we launched in 2008. Our mission is to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the chance to enjoy and be passionate about these creators. Everything we do is driven by our love for music and podcasting. Today, we are the world’s most popular audio streaming subscription service.
Global COVID and Vaccination Disclosure
Spotify is committed to safety and well-being of our employees, vendors and clients. We are following regional guidelines mandating vaccination and testing requirements, including those requiring vaccinations and testing for in-person roles and event attendance. For the US, we have mandated that all employees and contractors be fully vaccinated in order to work in our offices and externally with any third-parties. For all other locations, we strongly encourage our employees to get vaccinated and also follow local COVID and safety protocols.",https://se.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appsharedroid&jk=24fe08341cb61f4b

Business Analyst Subscriptions Capabilities (m/f/d),BFS finance Münster GmbH,Stockholm,"We are looking for a
Product Owner / Business Analyst for Subscriptions Capabilities (m/f/d)
Work from Berlin, Münster, Verl, Amsterdam, Oslo, Stockholm, Tallinn
So what are we looking for?
As the subscription economy is booming, so are the different use cases and needs. Let’s illustrate that with two examples. Some subscriptions, like car subscriptions, deal in high risks and open up room for different add-ons or pricing options, recurring or usage-based. Not to forget ad hoc costs like parking fines. In other cases, complexity comes from a B2B set-up with intricate billing based on complex tiered rate plans.
To be effective in today's marketplace, you require a high level of flexibility to match your consumers’ expectations. At the same time you need the capability to reliably deal with complex set-ups and growing markets. We want to provide a backbone for our clients that provides this combination of flexibility and reliability. It allows them to focus on their products and services and leave the admin to us.
As the Product Owner, you’ll work closely with all the subscription stakeholders to align the diverse needs towards a satisfying subscription experience for our clients and their customers. You'll translate the various needs into clear business stories and user stories, and guide the involved product teams in developing a seamless E2E solution.
In this volatile and uncertain market, you are geared towards an agile approach. This means iteratively developing new capabilities and then taking the time to listen to the clients and use their feedback to adapt and improve I the next iteration. Comfortably working with tech teams and translating back and forth between tech and business will be as much part of your day as E2E business process design.
To you pre-sales talks are not just about explaining about the benefits your product can offer.
They are very much an opportunity to keep learning about market requirements. They also present a chance to understand the individual needs of the potential client so that you can continually validate that your product really is offering answers to those needs.
What will you need?
3+ years experience in a role bridging the gap between business and IT, preferably as Agile Product Owner.
Outstanding ability to consider the big picture, think E2E and ensure optimization does not have negative impacts in the process somewhere down the line.
Ideally, experience as business process manager with BPMN skills.
Understanding of the e-commerce landscape and how merchants, platforms and solution providers interact.
Ideally 1+ year of experience in the subscription economy — minimum a sound basic understanding of the various types of subscriptions.
Excellent degree of communication skills, being able to effectively communicate both the strategic vision and specific details to various stakeholders — from senior leadership to individual product team members.
Responsible, communicative, assertive and open to intercultural and cross-functional issues.
Desire to constantly gain new insights on client and customer needs paired with the ability to react quickly to feedback, problems and even flops in order to deliver the best possible product to our clients and customers.
Excellent degree of analytical skills, ability to interpret data and trends, diagnose problems, and recommend effective action plans to resolve issues.
Ability to write clear and concise requirements focussing on needs, encouraging the team and leaving room to develop processes and features. At the same time, making use of a high IT affinity to understand tech challenges and ways of working.
Creativity and curiosity. #Listen and #CreateTheNext

Cloud Architect,Humblebee,411 05 GöteborgDistans,"Are you ready to work at Sweden's outstanding digital product & service company?
Why not join a workplace that gives you freedom, inspiration, incredible colleagues and a chance to work the way you want with projects you'll love.
Maybe you saw this article on Medium and thought it sounded exactly like the place you'd like to spend your days?
What we're looking for:
We are currently looking to employ a Cloud Architect. We think you are interested in taking a leading role in the dev team, and that you are as excited as we are by what can be built with cloud technologies. Because we are champions of cross-functional teams, we work actively to remove the divide between tech and design.
Humblebee’s tech stack has been heavily focused on Node, React, GraphQL and serverless technologies for the last three years. We are expecting to evolve with more languages as our assignments grow in complexity. Our implementations are centered around the Big Three clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP) in which we think you probably already have a bit of experience. Ideally you have worked with microservices and event-driven architectures since that’s a pattern that we use a lot and happen to fit our clients very well.
Our way of working
Our work is naturally driven by UX and service design. We extend this notion when it comes to architecture and technical solutions by also being informed by domain-driven design meaning that our software should reflect the client’s business, not be just a technical-jargon construct. We prefer microservices rather than monoliths and love the cloud and the possibilities that it gives for creating performant, reliable and secure applications that can scale over time.
As a Cloud Architect at Humblebee, you will:
Advise, develop and coordinate secure and scalable cloud architectures that meets customer and project requirements
Advise customers on selection of cloud services and technology platform setup
Inspire the team to deliver on the Humblebee architecture strategy
Create, present and propose solutions through presentations, maps, diagrams, IaC files and any other means
Setup metrics and diagnostic tools to calculate spend and usage of services
Setup pipelines that automate deployment and releasing of our software
Interface with the customer’s IT/tech organization, ensure relevant compliance, and provide assistance for them to integrate the solution
Create high-level (proof-of-concept) implementations when needed
You are as important as your skills
We employ people as much for their human traits as their competence and skill sets. We like good humans around us. We work in a collaborative environment (design sprints, development sprints, workshops with clients etc) and therefore we employ people who are empathetic, kind, patient and gracious.

We work hard to create a unique experience for the customer, owner, and driver. The thrill of driving the car, the digital experience of buying, owning, and controlling a Polestar require us to push the limits of technology and software development. Sustainability has been there from the beginning and we have set a moonshot goal for climate-neutral cars in 2030. There is an ocean of opportunities in this for talented IT professionals who want to dive in and make a difference.
The Role
A Cloud Software Architect at Polestar helps the long-term vision of cloud and software architecture and acts as a decision-maker in high-level design choices and technical standards, such as platforms and coding standards. This role will be part of the Technical Standards team. Working in that group means, among other tasks, setting the guardrails for software development and architecture in the product teams, as well as helping domain- and solution architects to build the best possible software solutions. The Cloud Architect is both a visionary and hands-on practitioner in regard to cloud technology and its usage at Polestar. In short, you will:

Set the standards for software development and ensure that the guardrails are followed by close interactions with the different development teams.
Ensure guardrails include quality, security and privacy aspects in collaboration with the Information Security team.
Maintain close relationships with key cloud partners (including AWS, Microsoft, Google and Cloudflare) together with the technical lead of the cloud platform, to maximize the value of the cloud platforms over time.
Coach and help the development teams and other areas of the business to deliver the best possible software.
Who you are
In order to thrive as our new Cloud Software Architect, we believe that you are comfortable with full-stack development and modern programming principles, perhaps even in product-led digital organizations. You probably have great knowledge of software architecture frameworks and design patterns needed for developing effective code, as well as experience in microservices such as AWS stack and tooling. Knowledge in Software Lifecycle Management and QA practices is considered a great plus as well. Specifically, we believe your experience includes the following:

Hands-on cloud architecture experience, ideally with infrastructure-as-code tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK or similar. We use AWS most extensively, but also run workloads in Azure and Google Cloud Platform.
Experience with serverless technologies such as AWS Lambda, including thorough understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of such approaches.
Hands-on development experience with either native or web-to-native tooling and frameworks.
Experience with reactive JavaScript frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, etc.
Using a variety of API styles and messaging patterns in distributed systems, e.g., REST, gRPC, GraphQL, pub/sub, request/reply.
Diverse experience in relational and NoSQL database technologies, e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
Application monitoring and observability.
Test-driven development and domain-driven design.
Development in cross-functional agile teams, and ideally practical experience of team leadership.
Personal Qualities
Specific experience is all good and well, but it’s important to state that we’re looking for a colleague who can grow with the company, drive us forward and ultimately enjoy working together with our amazing team. Polestar is a fast-growing company, taking on the world with innovative ideas and new ways of thinking. To thrive, you shouldn’t be afraid to take space, work creatively and engage your colleagues by initiating new processes and practices. In short, you probably:

Possess strong communication skills with the ability to align the organization on complex technical decisions
Enjoy acting as a coach and mentor with the goal to grow and maximize your team’s potential
Are excited about trying new solutions outside standard approved practices
Embrace a culture of trust and complete transparency
Promote free thought and feel energized by ideas from others
Are brave and rebellious, willing to challenge the status quo
Are a learner and teacher, not stopping at what you know today and what you can teach others right now

We know that a change is needed. We also know that each one of us can help bring about that change. Our commitment to becoming climate-neutral by 2040 is just as important to us as being inclusive, diverse, and innovative. Together, we are creating, collaborating and experimenting to usher in a new era of sustainable mobility.
We are an electric performance brand, determined to improve the society we live in.

"CloudBackend, Sveriges nästa tech-under, söker senior C++-utvecklare!",Framtiden,Linköping,"
  
   
    ”Det här är en unik chans att vara med och bygga en global, revolutionerande tjänst. De tekniska utmaningar vi har löst anses allmänt vara omöjliga att lösa; men det är vad vi gör. Vi löser det omöjliga, varje dag. Vårt team står bakom två av cloud-marknadens mest kända varumärken och vi vet att CloudBackend kommer bli det tredje.” 
     
   
  
  
   
  
   Daniel Arthursson
  
  
  
    Senior C++-utvecklare med produktfokus 
    
  
  
   CloudBackend står i begrepp att lansera en revolutionerande ny databastjänst, en ”Edge Database Platform as a Service” (Edge dbPaaS). Tjänsten gör utvecklare signifikant mer produktiva, då alla utmaningar med att utveckla och hantera API:er för molndatabaser är lösta från start. Samtidigt är all data synkad med alla uppkopplade enheter och noder, för att därigenom ytterligare förenkla applikationsutvecklingen. Detta möjliggör för front-end-utvecklare att bygga en komplett applikationslösning och därigenom bli full-stack-utvecklare.
  
  
  
    Detta är en revolutionerande teknologi för utvecklare inom såväl web och mobil-applikationer som IoT-applikationer. Det är en nyckelteknologi för att möjliggöra decentralisering av data, edge-computing och teknikskiftet till databaser som en tjänst, istället för att manuellt installera och köra databaser på ett moln.
    
  
  
    Produktlanseringen är beräknad till slutet av Q2 2022, varför vi nu behöver fler duktiga utvecklare till vårt team. Vi har en väldigt ambitiös och spännande utvecklingsplan och vi räknar även med att få in omfattande feedback och önskemål från kunder och användare efter lanseringen.
  
  
  
    Vårt mål är att bygga en tjänst från Linköping som används av miljoner utvecklare över hela världen. Vi är övertygade om att det finns en möjlighet för vår dbPaaS att etableras på en marknad som idag domineras av bolag som AWS, Azure och Google Cloud – medan dessa bolag samtidigt är leverantörer till oss och presumtiva återförsäljare av vår tjänst. I och med skiftet till decentralisering och edge-computing finns det en möjlighet för nya aktörer som CloudBackend att komma med innovativa tjänster.
  
  
  
    DINA ARBETSUPPGIFTER
    
  
  
    Som senior C++ utvecklare på CloudBackend kommer du ingå i SCRUM-teamet och arbeta för att realisera bolagets product roadmap och driva utveckling av densamma. Det är ett innovativt arbete fokuserat på produktutveckling av företagets egna databastjänst. Du blir en viktig del av företaget och kommer vara en nyckeldel i utvecklingen av nya lösningar och arkitekturer.

    OM FÖRETAGET
    
  
  
    CloudBackends Database Platform as a Service är en decentraliserad, policy-driven databas som minskar svarstider genom att lagra data i molnet, i edgen och på enheter distribuerat. Tjänsten är helt unik och lanseras under 2022, med avsikt att nå miljontals användare världen över.
  
  
  
    Med CloudBackend kan en startup eller apputvecklare lansera en global tjänst med prestanda över hela världen som uppfyller alla lokala datalagringsdirektiv, utan att det krävs en enorm utvecklingsinsats. App- och webbutvecklare som normalt lägger mycket tid på datahantering mellan klienter och backend kan istället lägga tiden på att förbättra användarupplevelse och funktionalitet. CloudBackends kunder kan helt enkelt lansera bättre lösningar snabbare, med mindre resurser, där de slipper tråkig ”data plumbing”, synkning av data, eller drift av utspridda databaser i molnet.

  About Humly

But we haven’t finished yet. We are continuously improving and developing our marketplace and expanding our offer into new international markets.
   Humly has 60 employees working at our offices in Gothenburg in Sweden and Fareham, Milton Keynes, Manchester and Birmingham in the UK. We have over 3,000 registered teachers and agreements with over 4,000 schools in Sweden and the UK.
   Humly has financially strong and active owners, Viking Ventures, and have raised 10 MEUR. We see great potential for the company and have a high ambition.  The Humly platform consists of multiple web clients written in React.js and mobile apps for iOS and Android written in React Native that connect to Ruby on Rails API. Data is permanently stored in the MongoDB database and temporarily cached in Redis.  The infrastructure is run on Amazon Web Services with Infrastructure As Code approach (Terraform).
  
   About the role
   Our user base and business is growing quickly. Our marketplace is becoming more and more demanding to maintain and develop. With the extensive need for our platform and exciting opportunities, we need a well-working development team and technical infrastructure to help us scale our platform and reach our goals and ambitions.  We are looking for someone in our management team who owns the platform's technical aspects and builds a development organization that can further maintain, scale and develop the marketplace.
   As a CTO, you will own the budget and investment plan for the engineering team. You will work closely with the company CPO to develop a scalable and loved digital marketplace. It is your responsibility to align the technical strategy with the company strategy. We expect you to be a proactive and solution-oriented member of the management team.
   We will need an excellent team to help us, so you must enjoy building and forming a development team. Being a good leader who aligns with our values is more important than having the perfect technical skillset.
   Humly is right now having a development team of seven people in Poland. They are not employed by Humly but work full-time for Humly. We have cooperated with them since 2017, and it works very well. The product management team consists of a CPO, a UX designer, two UI designers and a data scientist located at the Humly headquarters in Gothenburg, Sweden. With the great potential ahead of us, the next step in our company development is to build an internal engineering team. We are looking for a CTO to take full responsibility for building and developing a team of high performers that are fun to work with.
   The current development organization works data-driven and agile. We don’t follow any exact agile process model but have designed our own with similar principles. You must prefer being outcome-driven, running small sprints and deploying often.
  
   What can Humly offer you?
   At Humly, we help and motivate each other. The team always comes first, and we like to work together. Seeing and working for the whole is essential, as is having fun, setting high goals, and constantly working for improvement. We have high ambitions for both the individual and the company’s development, but at the same time care about being a friendly workplace where everyone has a place.  In addition to a competitive basic salary, Humly also offers:
  
    Annual bonus. 
   Pension scheme. 
   Flexible and modern workstyle. 
   Share option scheme. 
   Six weeks annual paid leave. 
   A well-working agile team with lots of real user needs to solve.
    A Viking venture community of 20+ other companies to learn and share knowledge with. 
   A globally important and exciting solution that creates a lot of good values for our users and all the children and students they meet every day.
  
  
   Qualifications:
  
   5+ years CTO experience.
   Speaking Swedish is a plus but not required. The team communicates in English.
   Experience from scaling a multi-national platform.
   Well documented experience as a leader.
    Experience in team management and cross-functional team coordination.
  
   We also value your personality highly and think it’s important that it aligns with our values and culture at Humly. We believe that you will like working with us if you are communicative, have high integrity, like to laugh and are willing to walk the extra mile to achieve our goals together.
  
   Location
   Humly is a hybrid organisation with a team spread over many locations in Sweden, England and Poland. We harness the power of remote work and have a structure to build a solid collaborative culture without meeting every day. For this role, it will be preferable if the candidate is situated in Sweden or the UK where we currently have team members. You don't have to be living in a city where we have offices.

  Are you ready to work at Sweden's outstanding digital product & service company?
   Why not join a workplace that gives you freedom, inspiration, incredible colleagues and a chance to work the way you want with projects you'll love.
   Maybe you saw this article on Medium and thought it sounded exactly like the place you'd like to spend your days?
   What we're looking for:
   We're looking for an experienced developer to join our team in Gothenburg. It doesn’t matter that much if you call yourself front-end, back-end or full stack. The most important thing is that you’re good at programming and web development in general, and that you love developing great experiences and building what’s needed.
   Together with the team, you will work closely with current and new clients to create digital products and services. Your main focus is the Javascript stack, and you should have good experience with both Node.js and React.
   Our way of working
   Our work is naturally driven by UX and service design. We extend this notion when it comes to architecture and technical solutions by also being informed by domain-driven design meaning that our software should reflect the client’s business, not be just a technical-jargon construct. We prefer microservices rather than monoliths and love the cloud and the possibilities that it gives for creating performant, reliable and secure applications that can scale over time.
   What we would expect from you:
   
   You love working with Javascript and Typescript. 
   You're experienced in React and/or other frameworks like Angular, Vue etc. 
   You communicate via API:s, preferably Node.js and GraphQL 
   You're interested in technologies like Serverless architecture, Headless CMS etc. 
   You enjoy collaborating with a multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural team. 
   You experiment with new technologies. 
   You spread energy and inspire your team members. 
  
  You are as important as your skills
   We employ people as much for their human traits as their competence and skill sets. We like good humans around us. We work in a collaborative environment (design sprints, development sprints, workshops with clients etc) and therefore we employ people who are empathetic, kind, patient and gracious. We are Humblebee.

The Company:

Jefferson Frank are working in partnership with an agile and forward thinking Fintech company that are based in Stockholm. Originally focusing on personal services to the regular worker, they made the decision to switch to the corporate market which has catapulted the company to being one of the most successful of it's type. Their service allows customers to pay ANY invoice with a credit card, making it an efficient operation for all parties. Furthermore, they charge around 3% for their services making them cheaper than factoring or loaning from a bank. In addition to this customers earn points which can offer a range of benefits in return.

As stated, the switch in markets has been hugely beneficial to this client and so they have experienced rapid growth as a result of this. They've achieved €5 million in turnover, grown 1100% in 3 years and have acquired €15 million in funding since the beginning of 2021. Now entering a scaling up phase they are aggressively hiring in 2022 to ensure they keep up with the demand they're experiencing for their services. This initially comes in the form of hiring for multiple Engineering Lead (s) to lead separate applications following a team re-structuring that is setting the company up for the future.


The Role:

As mentioned teams are currently being restructured and split into 2 separate applications which will allow them to deliver a premium service to their customers. The end goal here is to create 2 autonomous, self-sufficient teams which work independently from each other including an Engineering Lead, Product Manager, Quality Assurance and Developers. Both applications are build using the same infrastructure; Node.JS, React, Microservices and GCP. You'll be required to show your experience with full-stack development and a strong competence with all of these technologies. Preferably from a senior/similar role in the past.


This is a hands on position where you'll be immersed in a technical environment, much of your time will be spent coding full-stack. You'll be responsible for building and overseeing your team building API's, troubleshooting and fixing performance related issues and developing scalable solutions. Your core responsibility will be managing the entire application from an architectural standpoint to maintain performance and efficiency.

Both teams will work in an agile methodology and so you'll be managing the scrum. You will be working alongside the product manager, translating business needs into tech stories for developers whilst assurance due diligence is completed with quality assurance through code reviews. In addition to this, you'll be responsible for training and mentoring the more junior members of the development team.


Requirements:

Previous experience as an Engineering Lead or a similar, technical roleStrong full-stack experience with Node.JS & React (minimum 3 years) having built API's and/or microservices from scratch to be added to an already existing infrastructureCloud experience (preferably with GCP) used for deployment and hosting servicesExperience managing a microservices architecture
Preferable Requirements:

Previous experience as a software architect or having strong architectural responsibilities within a similar position in the pastStrong interest or previous experience with Fintech projects

In return, you'll be joining a rapidly expanding company that has unlimited potential with what is possible in the coming years. Now in significant growth phase, their product is growing in popularity and as a result they're investing heavily in this and marketing to capitalise in the lack of activity within their domain. You'll be joining a company that operates on a flat hierarchy meaning that every employee has the opportunity to add value and their voice can be heard. Furthermore, openness is one of their core values which is reflected in their practices. Alongside your salary, you'll receive a range of benefits including the ITP1 pension, wellness allowance, health insurance and 30 days holiday.

Erfaren Frontend-utvecklare till Iteam,Iteam,GöteborgDistans,"
  
   Världen är i ett viktigt skifte och Iteam försöker ta en ledande roll i den hållbara digitaliseringen. Vår process är enkel och självklar, att utgå från användaren, jobba i agila team och med öppen källkod. Tillsammans med våra kunder lyckas vi lösa problem av mer komplex natur och skapar ett mer hållbart värde - både i form av innovativa produkter och högpresterande team.
    Vi har redan året fullt av spännande projekt och mer är på väg in. Våra kunder är allt från stora offentliga organisationer och företag, till mindre bolag och startups. Vi har även rena innovationsprojekt, såsom Predictive Movement där vi utvecklar system för att samordna transporter i glesbygd. Flera av våra uppdrag görs som öppen källkod, som det nyligen lanserade Klimatkollen eller Netnods Robust Tjänst. Hos Iteam är chansen stor att du kan få jobba i renodlade open-source projekt.
  
  
    Rollen
    Just nu så söker vi en erfaren frontend-utvecklare för att stärka upp i både befintliga och kommande projekt.
    Vi ser en kandidat som kan styra sitt eget arbete, leda och mentorera mer juniora kollegor, samt samarbeta med UX-designers, utvecklare, och produktägare. Du sätter dig snabbt in i kundens affär och användarnas behov, och är van vid att omsätta dessa till lämpliga uppgifter för dig och dina kollegor. Dina erfarenheter och kunskaper gör dig bekväm i att välja rätt teknisk lösning i alla situationer.
    På Iteam är vi alltid pragmatiska när det kommer teknikval i våra projekt. För närvarande använder vi oftast React och Next.js som frontend-tekniker, så vi ser med fördel att man har mycket goda kunskaper om dessa. Vi utvärderar kontinuerligt nya tekniker, så både intresset av och kunskaper från andra ramverk och lösningar ser vi som en viktig egenskap hos alla sökande. Våra projekt har höga krav på tillgänglighet och kodkvalitet, så kandidater bör ha kunskaper om UI-testning (Selenium, Cucumber, eller liknande) samt förståelse för hur man implementerar stöd för de olika WCAG-nivåerna.
    Vi ser att du kan kommunicera professionellt (B2) på engelska i både tal och skrift och minst grundläggande (A2) på svenska.
    Arbetsort

    Vi är en hybrid av produktbolag och konsultbyrå. Genom våra team tar vi stort ansvar för produkterna vi utvecklar och jobbar nära våra kunder, mer som kollegor än som kund/leverantör. Vi är därför inte traditionella resurskonsulter utan har alltid ett fullständigt team som hjälps åt att lösa uppgiften tillsammans med kunden.
    Som konsulter har vi kunder inom olika branscher med olika tekniker så innebär det att vi får en högre grad av lärande. Vi har även ett kontinuerligt arbete med lärande i form av kodluncher, labb-dagar, samt en utbildningspott reserverad för varje anställd. Vi har även automatiserat bort mycket av den administration som andra konsulter har vilket för dig innebär att du slipper göra tidsredovisning.

Experienced Full-Stack Developers,GESHDO,211 46 MalmöDistans,"
  Right now we are looking for full-stack developers with four or more years of experience who have worked in one or more of the three main cloud platforms. You should feel comfortable with both front-end and back-end development and have a passion for coding. Come and be part of our GESHDO-family!
   Who are you? 
   We imagine that you have four or more years of experience working in full-stack development using agile principles. We also believe that you are passionate about software and enjoy coding as much as we do, maybe even more so!
   For this role, the ideal candidate is someone who finds developing solutions on one of the three big cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) exciting and who has experience with Node.js or C on the back-end and React/Vue on the front-end.  Your personality should be solution oriented and daring, able to see opportunities in challenges and willing to try out both new tech and new solutions.
   What will you do?
  
   Be a part of one of our awesome teams. You can read more about them here.
   Hack the Cloud. We work with bleeding-edge technology and our competencies cover the three main cloud platforms, GCP, AWS, and Azure, although we focus mainly on AWS currently. We see it as our mission to push what's possible in a cloud environment and challenge the written and unwritten rules about best-practices.
   Write code. We take pride in calling ourselves developers! We love to test new frameworks and are always trying to improve our ways of working. The philosophy is we build it, we run it. That's why striving for cloud-native technologies, such as serverless, is really important.
   Consulting. We are all consultants and our clients trust us to find the best IT solutions for them. At GESHDO you will work closely with clients and other talented IT professionals.
  
  
   What can GESHDO offer you
   
   Targeted goals: Our employees are what makes us special and keeping you happy and technically challenged is what drives us forward. A few things we offer to achieve this is education in new technologies, meetings with our career coach/psychotherapist and the best tools to write code. 
   Transparency: We are founded by two developers who drew the core values from their own extensive experiences as consultants. One important thing for us is that we are an open book, nothing is secret and anyone wanting to be part of the decision-making process is welcomed with open arms. 
   Social environment: The work-life balance is key to us. Meetings are during business hours and overtime is something we always try to avoid. We also like each other and try to get together as often as we can. Something's that we currently do (which are optional to attend of course) are going to conferences, arrange hackathons, exercise together and get together at after works. 
   Competitive benefits package: We provide you a great pension program and protection if you get sick. You will get access to our personal trainer and our psychotherapist/careers coach. When you join us, we also give you a clear idea of how you increase your salary level and reach the next step in your career! 
   The “GESHDO philosophy”: We want to challenge the industry standards to once again make the result for the end-user the primary focus. Development should not have convenience as its primary focus, challenging yourself to use new technologies, use new ways of thinking and testing the boundaries of what is possible is what makes development a useful tool rather than a restriction. If you are also someone who would like to work in this way, we believe that we will have a lot of fun working together!  
  
  We are GESHDO and we get shit done! Nice to meet you!

Front-End Engineering Lead,Hedvig,Stockholm,"
  
   
    Since you’ve landed on this page, you already know Hedvig is a mover and shaker in insurtech, and think you might have what it takes to join us. As the only loved insurance company in Sweden (in the world?), we’ve proven that it’s possible to disrupt an entire industry with people’s best interests at heart. But our journey is just beginning, starting with Sweden, Denmark and Norway! We’ve been working hard since the very beginning to change an industry that is hard to love – to something at least likeable. At Hedvig we believe the only way to do so is to work with loveable people.
   
   
   
     The frontend team shapes the purchase journey of potential new Hedvig members as well as existing ones. The user experience is central for Hedvig which makes the team dear to the company. The team is relatively small yet very skilled. The team is working hard to build Scandinavia’s most loved insurance company. We work closely with product, design, back-end, as well as Mobile app developers to create the best experience for our customers. Currently and due to Hedvig’s expansion in terms of markets and products we are hiring an Engineering Manager to lead the team.
   
   
   
     What about the role?
   
   
    As an Engineering Lead, you will never be far from solving problems and writing code, yet you will have the responsibility of leading and coaching our talented but small front-end team.
   
   
   
     You will have the responsibility of communicating with stakeholders by explaining solutions and technical trade-offs. This role aims to bring clarity to the organization over what we do and how we do it.
   
   
   
     You’ll make decisions and solve issues such as code scalability and exiting UX challenges as Hedvig is currently expanding its product offering and new markets.
   
   
   
     In addition to the support on daily tasks, you will ensure that your team is constantly developing their skills and capabilities.
   
   
   
     What about you?
   
   
    You’ve most likely been working with front-end web development for some years, and you have some coaching or leadership experience. But more importantly, you have a strong interest and motivation to develop in this direction.
   
   
   
     A big part of the role includes hands-on coding, and you should be familiar with our tech stack. The site is powered by React, Emotion, and TypeScript, and on top of this, we also use GraphQL with Apollo, a little bit of Koa, and the headless CMS Storyblok.
   
   
   
     Again, those are not hard requirements! If you have a different profile but you see that you have relevant skills and you think you can do a remarkable job, apply and send an email to us motivating why we should meet you. We believe that a good developer is a problem-solver who is capable of learning any new tech stack. We highly value both a good attitude and personality as a leader and place a lot of emphasis on these ""soft skills"".
     
   
   
    
   
    What about us?
   
   
     As part of the Hedvig team, you quickly notice that ""general truths"" are not accepted without being questioned. We're an enthusiastic group of people who love to challenge each other to find the best way forward. We don't care who says something; we care about what's being said. We put a lot of effort into building a trusting culture where freedom, collective thinking, and individual ownership have center stage. We're not perfect–far from it – but we talk about and learn from our mistakes and imperfections to improve continuously. And we have a lot of fun along the way! As individuals, as a team, and as a company.
   
   
  
   
    Sounds like your next challenge? You can start by sending us an application. If you don't feel ready maybe you want to know more about us? Then check out our LinkedIn page where we regularly post inspiring thoughts from our people, and also our Career page where we (try to) share our values If you have questions regarding the position, please feel free to write to careers@hedvig.com.
   
   
   
     What the process will most likely look like (we will let you know if there are any changes)
   
   
     30 minute chat with to learn more about you – and tell you more about us!
   
   
     Interview with one of our hiring leaders.
   
   
     Case interview with our developers from the team.
   
   
    ️Final interview with one of our founders. 
   
   
    
   
    FYI: We may ask candidates to complete a Personality and Logical Thinking test in order to understand your profile better during the process. We use these tests to avoid biases in the recruitment process. You will get to see your results and hopefully learn more about yourself as well! If you have any opinions or questions about these assessments, please feel free to let us know, we like to receive feedback and continuously rethink our processes.

Frontend Architect,SeenThis,120 32 StockholmDistans,"Frontend Architect
As we grow, we want to create a unified look-and-feel for the SeenThis’ products and applications. Therefore, we are now hiring a frontend developer and architect for the SeenThis tech team.
If you are motivated by leading frontend initiatives with state-of-the-art technologies, this should be the perfect fit for you.
We are looking for someone who has been deep diving in Vue.js the last few years (or other modern frontend frameworks) and is casually scrolling through Dribble or Behance with their morning coffee.
You probably have a good sense for design, user experience and work best in a role where you can be close to the craft (code) – but still have the ability to zoom out and contribute to the bigger picture as well.
About SeenThis
Since 2017, SeenThis has been evolving screen experiences for everyone, everywhere. With our groundbreaking adaptive streaming technology, we are transforming the distribution of digital content, to increase performance and reduce impact on the climate.
With billions of streams served for more than 1,000 brands in over 40 countries, we push petabytes of data through our systems each month. If you’re wondering about requests per second, we’ll tell you over a Zoom coffee.
“That sounds cool, but what about the people?”
Well, here you can find pretty much everyone. Nerds, introverts, extroverts, sales gurus, start-up junkies, 9-to-5ers, daydreamers, visionaries – yes, we even have an office plant named Fred.
Our tech team describes our culture as encouraging, inclusive, and innovative. They believe that both personal and professional growth comes from relentlessly solving new and evermore complex problems by testing new solutions together with people that both challenge you and make you laugh. They believe in you, and your ability to deliver what is expected, and will give you the freedom to choose how.
We are growing fast and raised a new round of financing to fuel the buildout of our organization and the resulting global expansion. Although we’ve already come a long way, we feel like our journey just has begun and hope that you want to join this fantastic team on our mission to reshape the internet — for good.
About the role
As Frontend Architect, you will have the opportunity to develop our frontend, design, user experience – and take it to the next level! In this role, you will be hands on with coding while simultaneously setting the standard for our front-end vision and strategy.
As the team is mainly focused on back-end development today, you will be responsible for initiating, driving, and leading frontend initiatives – of course, with the support of your other team members.
We are currently developing our CMS as well as our client-facing applications “Video Drop” & “Image drop”. In addition to frontend development, we hope you will analyze our customer flows, to develop and optimize the user experience accordingly.
Our goal is to create a common component library to be able to reuse and make the development process more efficient. Also, it is great if you can contribute to the documentation of the frontend parts so that we can share knowledge with existing and new members of the team.

Do you have the ambition to take a Team Lead role in the future? Great! As the teams are growing, we are strongly encouraging those who want to help take responsibility for others.
We expect you to:

Have approximately 5 years of experience with frontend development

Be highly experienced with Javascript (preferably Vue.js)

Have been involved in bigger frontend projects and created a uniform, yet creative frontend/design

Have a passion for driving change, setting the structure, and sharing knowledge across teams

Professional proficiency in English

We offer you:

The opportunity to grow with a Swedish tech company

An exciting role with ownership for the frontend strategy
Great compensation for great work

A flexible workplace with a remote hybrid policy, and a social HQ office by the water, close to Södermalm in Stockholm

Application
We are excited to welcome you to the SeenThis-family!
Please apply as soon as possible as we review applications and interview on a continuous basis.

Frontend developer,Boozt,Malmö,"Frontend developer
THE OPPORTUNITY
At Boozt we work in small cross functional teams of up to six developers in a big community. In total we are 170 developers spread across 5 locations. At Boozt, a high standard of code is important, which we manage through the latest technology stack, internal code reviews and sharing knowledge through hackathons, conferences and weekly talks. Here we love to develop, not only the code but also ourselves as developers!
Our front-end developers are constantly looking for ways to improve front-end performance and be on top of user-centric metrics like the Core Web Vitals. In our infinite quest for better performance we use Datadog RUM (real user monitoring), to look at real time data from our users, create dashboards and define our SLOs. We also develop our own systems and improve our ways of working throughout the whole organization.
We are currently looking for two frontend developers. One of you will be focusing and be a part of a team that is building our UI component library. The UI component library is a design system that will make our work more efficient - easier onboarding, faster time to production for features and better maintainability with trickle down updates throughout our webshops - this will allow us to focus on even more new cool features to improve the experience for our users.
The other one main task will be to continuously improve and add new features to “the Editor” in our CMS. This is an own developed desktop-like application (called “the Editor”), as part of our Content Management System, which makes it possible for our internal stakeholders to create and publish landing pages and campaigns on our webshops, without any real time help from a developer. Working very close to business for us is a must as we can get immediate feedback, create new features and improve the user experience.
WHAT YOU WILL DO
Front-end development in Typescript and Javascript. We use React and Redux.
Develop and deliver high-quality products and services, for example build and develop our new UI component library or our own developed CMS Editor.
Participate in design and code reviews.
Identify and address performance bottlenecks.
Identify areas of improvement and proactively implement those with your team.
 YOUR PROFILE
At least 2 years experience within JavaScript
You have experience with at least one Javascript frameworks, such as React, Vue.js or similar.
BS or MS degree in Computer Science or a related technical field desirable.
Fluent in English since this is our corporate language (only applications in English will be considered)
To be successful in our culture it is a lot about enjoying working in an agile, dynamic and team based environment. Here we love to discuss our solutions in order to always improve. You are a person that is open to sharing your knowledge, are curious and humble about the fact that the only thing consistent in technology is change.
Please apply for this position as soon as possible as we work with ongoing selection and interviews.

Welcome with your application!

   There is room for everyone! We are a very diverse team that learns from each other. We believe you will do amazing things here - no matter who you are.
   We’re proud to be the first Swedish company that made it to the top-10 list of Financial Times’ list of the 1,000 fastest growing companies in Europe.

   Ok, sounds cool but what about the role?
   As a Frontend developer at Qred, you’ll be a part of a cross-functional team together with other Qredsters with different tech competencies. We have a few things in mind when we build our teams, but in general, we put together Backend Developers, Frontend Developers and App Developers with UX designers and Data Scientists, to be able to efficiently do our daily work and create a feeling of ownership for our products. Every team setting is led by an Engineering Manager and a Product Manager, to make sure everyone is included, listened to, aligned, and heading in the same direction.
   We also believe in the trust in our developer’s capability of implementing, testing, reviewing, deploying daily, and operating their software in production.
   Sounds like a good way of working right? Here’s what we're looking for:
  
    A flexible and positive mindset as well as strong team spirit
    Proven knowledge and at least 2 years of work experience in writing, releasing and maintaining web and mobile applications using the following techs:
     
     Javascript 
     React or React Native 
     AWS Serverless Technologies
    
  
  
   Did you check in those boxes? Here are more reasons to join us
   First of all, this is the place to be if you want to develop your skills. The company is growing fast, and our Qredsters along with it. Our non-bureaucratic, flat organization with delegated responsibilities has a short way from idea to action.
   In addition to our great culture influenced by our values Transparency, Innovation and Passion, you get to work with the latest cutting edge techniques offered by AWS, responsibility for the whole development chain and last but not least (!) a bunch of new competent colleagues to learn from and get to know.
  
   One last thing - if you’re about to send in your application
   This is a full-time, permanent position based in our headquarters in Stockholm. If you’re not living in the Stockholm area and are open to remote work, you could still be an interesting candidate for us!
   Don’t wait to send in your application! We're reviewing applications on a rolling basis and while the start date is flexible, the right candidate can join us immediately.   
  Qred celebrates diversity and does not discriminate based on ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability status, or any other applicable characteristics protected by law.

  Frontend developer
   Would you call yourself a “frontend focused” developer? Do you have 1-3 years of professional experience in Javascript and modern frontend frameworks like Vue.js, React.js, or Svelte? 
  Do you aspire to work in a smaller, but growing company that values flexibility, fast-forwardness, and having fun along the ride? 
  Then this is a great opportunity to join our talented team of 10+ engineers in Stockholm. Expect to grow and be challenged!

   “That sounds cool, but what about the people?”
   Well, here you can find pretty much everyone. Nerds, introverts, extroverts, sales gurus, start-up junkies, 9-to-5ers, daydreamers, visionaries – yes, we even have an office plant named Fred.
   Our tech team describes our culture as encouraging, inclusive, and innovative. They believe that both personal and professional growth comes from relentlessly solving new and evermore complex problems by testing new solutions together with people that both challenge you and make you laugh.

  About the role
   We are currently hiring developers to our applications team for developing our CMS as well as our client-facing applications “Video Drop” & “Image Drop”. That means you will both work on our internal tools, where creative solutions and fast implementation is key, as well as on our external client-facing applications where design and usability are of high importance. 
  One of our goals is to create a common component library to be able to reuse UI elements and make the development process more efficient. 
  Our stack is Javascript-based with Node.js, and we are using mostly Vue.js and some React.js for frontend. The communication between our frontends and backends is mostly through GraphQL and REST APIs.

   About you
   We are looking for developers with around 1-3 years of experience in JavaScript development, with experience in modern frontend technologies like Vue.js and React. It's great if you have experience in backend development as well, since the role will not be limited to purely frontend development.

   You will join the Annotation team within our Ground Truth Production product area. The team’s mission is to enable effortless and efficient production of high-quality ground truth. It is responsible for the tools used by annotators on camera, LiDAR, and radar data. The cross-functional team identifies valuable improvements and suitable solutions. Some current skills in the group include UX/UI design, frontend and backend development, and machine learning. We are now looking for additional product developers strong in frontend development to join.
   What you will do
   Our users’ job is to produce high-quality ground truth, and they rely on us to provide the tools enabling them to do that. Speed is essential, but also accuracy. We need to minimise the annotation time while keeping the quality high. A straightforward and precise UI for professional users is at the job’s core. 2D and 3D performance, as well as loading times, are other essential parts. Beyond the pure frontend parts, interactive machine learning tools can simplify or even automate many tedious tasks. Together with the team, you will prioritise what to build based on usage data and the value you expect from each solution.

   Who you are
   We are looking for several candidates with solid skills in building web applications using TypeScript and React. Experience in video, 3D, drawing apps, or experience using D3 or Three.js is a great plus. An interest in metrics or testing user interactions is also meritorious.
   At Annotell, seniority means deepening and broadening individual skills, helping the team and colleagues grow and succeed, and improving the team’s effect by finding better solutions for more valuable problems. Seniority consists of both personal skills and understanding of the Annotell context. We are looking for both new senior colleagues and those earlier on their journey.
   You will be a part of a team at a startup with grand ambitions where we help each other to ensure everyone succeeds as Annotell succeeds. We believe you are an excellent fit if you enjoy working in a growth environment where you sometimes have to act under uncertainties and if you appreciate the responsibility that comes with our mission-driven and self-organising style. You are always up for learning new things and are inspired by reaching challenging goals as a team.
   What is in it for you?

    Strong values and purpose-driven company 
   Being part of defining and building the ground truth product 
   Workplace flexibility and work-life balance

Frontend Lead,Caspeco,753 20 UppsalaDistans,"
  Om Caspeco
   Dagens Caspeco uppstod år 2006 – i mötet mellan en legendarisk krögare och en smart Uppsala-student. Per Söderqvist hade drivit ett antal populära krogar, men med blandad ekonomisk framgång. När han drev krog i Uppsala tog han in en sommarpraktikant för att hjälpa honom att få koll på utgifter, inkomster, marginaler och bemanning. Med hjälp av ett egenutvecklat excel-ark kunde Per Söderqvist över en natt få en helt ny överblick – och lönsamheten steg. 
  Idag erbjuder Caspeco fyra kompletta system för krogar- och upplevelseindustrin. Vi kallar dem Bokning, Kassa, Personal och Analys. Bolaget består idag av cirka 100 medarbetare, 2500 kunder i en organisation där beslutsvägarna är korta, varje medarbetare gör skillnad, och nya idéer och initiativ premieras. Vi vill att våra medarbetare ska växa i takt med företaget och arrangerar regelbundet events som Uppsala.js och Uppsala Tech där vi delar med oss och lär oss av andra i branschen. Nu söker vi efter en Frontend Lead för Tid och Schema i vår fortsatta tillväxtresa!
  
   Din roll som Frontend Lead
   I rollen som Frontend Lead kommer du att tillhöra produktområdet Personal och vara delaktig i projekt som hör till Tid och Schema. De system vi bygger och underhåller omfattar såväl webbaserade verktyg för schemaläggning och uppföljning som mobil-appar och fristående applikationer för in- och utstämpling på arbetsplatsen. Det viktiga för oss är att tillhandahålla verktyg som är såväl användarvänliga som intelligenta.
   Tid-teamet är en viktig del eftersom schemaläggning är viktig del av våra kunders dagliga verksamhet. Framöver vill vi göra det på desktop och mobilen. Teamet har också planer på att få in AI i Schema. Det finns även en del där vi redan nu jobbar med AI med prognostiserad försäljning tex. 
  Dina kvalifikationer
   
    Bra på JavaScript/TypeScript 
   Flerårig professionell erfarenhet av frontendutveckling i React.js 
   God förståelse för frontendarkitektur och prestanda 
   Gärna erfarenhet av enhetstestning på frontend 
   Gärna erfarenhet av backendutveckling 
  
   Vi söker en erfaren och driven frontendutvecklare med fokus på React som både kan producera kod, ta arkitekturdiskussioner och agera mentor till mer juniora frontend-kollegor. Vi tror att du både har ett öga för användbarhet och kunskap om web/JavaScript-prestanda. Du gillar förmodligen att utveckla frontend med fokus på funktionalitet och prestanda. Har du arbetat med frontend-arkitektur är det ett stort plus. 
  Vad Caspeco erbjuder dig

We are the first community based holiday accommodation-booking website, dedicated to people with special needs and disabilities. We build and consolidate accessible services for disabled people and enable them to discover the world. But that is just the start...   We want you!  
  We're looking for a super ambitious front-end developer to join our rapidly growing tech team, full time and based in Malmö. The senior role will be multi-skilled and expected to execute quickly, while also providing input to higher level tasks. This is a fully hands-on position and will cover all aspects of front-end related development and bring value on technical product roadmap level. We are looking for a candidate that must have at least 5 years of experience and understand the dynamics of a start-up in a fast growth trajectory.
   Our tech + how we work
   
   Our front-end and dashboard are built with React, communicating with our backend via RESTful API. 
   Extensive front-end development experience in writing React.js, Node.js, TypeScript 
   Well familiarized with AWS structure and environment 
   We believe in using the best tools for the job, and value engineering expertise over language prowess. 
   We value: documentation, test coverage, code review, CI/CD and great team spirit. 
   We predominantly communicate over Slack, making little use of email internally. We do daily standups each morning via Google Hangouts. BitBucket is our repo of choice and we track progress via sprints in Jira project boards 
   We encourage discussion and debate, but place tremendous value on pragmatism and optimising for output. We're solving new categories of problems, and understanding our very best functionality will come about as a result of deep technical insights driven by engineering and design processes.
  
   
   You should apply if…
   
   You're passionate about crafting beautiful, pixel-perfect interfaces along awesome user experiences.. We believe that great design says a lot about ones approach across all of product design + engineering. Handiscover is geared towards users, communities and partners around the globe. Build a product you would use yourself, and bring your unique insight and perspective to the table as a developer in shaping our overarching product offering. 
   You like solving big problems. Our greatest challenges are yet on the horizon, and we'll need super hard working and creative minds to solve foundational infrastructure challenges for the world's largest travel community for people with special needs. 
   You value autonomy, moving fast and getting lots done. We have no time or interest for bureaucracy and micromanagement - we're moving super fast and you'll be required to take responsibility for delivering end to end working stable products. 
   You have the excellent communication touch, verbal and written english skills 
   You love data visualisation, and presenting nuanced insights in a compelling way. Our customers will rely on our data to make critical decisions, and this data has typically not been digestible. Help us to change that. 
   You want to make a huge impact, and share in the success of a company you've helped build. Our tech team is 5 strong today, but we are just getting started.

   Om Lägenhetsbyte.se 
   Vi har funnits sedan 2004 och är Sveriges ledande aktör inom bostadsbyten av hyresrätter. Vi är i grunden en digital tjänst som via en avancerad matchningsmotor kopplar ihop bostadsbytare med varandra baserat på deras önskemål. Vi satsar mycket på att ha en bra kundtjänst både digitalt och via telefon, samt att vi har andra tjänster för att hjälpa till vid bostadsbyte, t.ex. Bytesansökan och (psst, hemligt :D) snart en byteshandläggartjänst där vi sköter hela bytet åt kunder. Vi är i ett väldigt spännande läge med mycket roligt på gång. 
   Vårt uppdrag är att skapa en rörlighet i en annars orörlig marknad och att göra det enkelt att byta bostad när behovet finns. Vår vision är att vara den självklara slussen för alla bostadsbyten i Sverige. Våra kunder befinner sig över hela landet men till störst del i våra större städer där det är svårare att hitta nytt boende. 
   
    Exempel på utbud (Stockholm).
     I Sverige byts det 60 000 bostäder per år varav 6 000 via Lägenhetsbyte.se. Vi har ca 15 000 kunder varje månad. 
   
   Vi är idag 14 personer och kommer fortsätta växa med några till. Vi vill ha kul tillsammans och trivas på arbetet. Vi åker på 1-2 resor per år som tidigare gått till t ex Thailand, Franska rivieran och Palma de Mallorca.

Om Datscha
Nej, vi har ingenting med biltillverkning att göra! Datscha betyder faktiskt sommarhus på ryska, vilket nog ger dig en hint om vår produkt och verksamhet. Google kommer berätta för dig att vi är ”Sveriges ledande leverantör av tjänster för information och analys av kommersiella fastigheter” vilket är helt sant (med tillägget att vi faktiskt finns i fler länder än bara Sverige). Vi verkar inom området ”PropTech” och är ett tajt litet gäng (okej, kanske inte så litet nu längre) som älskar allt som har med fastighetsdata och teknologi att göra. Idag är vi över 70 medarbetare i 3 länder och har över 900 företag, däribland fastighetsägare och investerare, banker och konsulter som kunder. Vi känns och beter oss som en start-up samtidigt som vi har en mycket stabil ekonomi, har en stark ägare och har gått med vinst sedan start som är över 20 år sedan! Här är det alltså ingen risk att kaffet tar slut, vi lovar!

Vi har huvudansvar för innehållet, text & tonalitet samt konverteringsoptimering på sbab.se. Vi jobbar efter en datadriven process där en statistisk insikt leder till hypoteser som vi digitalt kan testa och se mätbara resultat på.
Vi tror att du är en van Frontendutvecklare som gillar webbutveckling och har goda kunskaper inom HTML, CSS, och Javascript/React.

  Nu har du chansen! Vi växer så det knakar och vi är i stort behov av erfarna frontend-utvecklare. Vi får in det ena spännande uppdraget efter det andra och just nu har vi en möjlighet att utöka vårt scrum-team som jobbar med webbapplikationer i Python och React. Funderar du på att gå vidare mot nya utmaningar och dessutom är nyfiken på hur det är att jobba som konsult, tveka inte att kontakta oss.
   Vem är du?
   För just det här uppdraget behöver du ha ett par års erfarenhet av systemutveckling inom Python och/eller React. Har du även erfarenhet av Redis, Docker, Kubernetes och/eller RabbitMQ är det ett stort plus men inget krav. Tycker du dessutom det är roligt att arbeta med REST och PostgreSQL är det här uppdraget som klippt och skuret för dig. Flytande svenska i tal och skrift är ett krav.
   Som person brinner du för problemlösning och triggas av att prova på nytt och utmana dina egna gränser. Nyfikenhet tillsammans med en stark vilja av att dela med sig av kunskaper till andra är egenskaper vi värderar högt.
   Vad är Nexer Mid?
   Nexer Mid har sitt upptagningsområde för orterna Jönköping, Växjö, Linköping och Skövde med omnejd.
   Vad innebär det att vara konsult på Nexer?
   Förutom att du får testa på nya branscher, branscher som leder utvecklingen och uppdrag som ställer dig inför nya och roliga utmaningar får du också en brant utvecklingskurva. Vi lägger stort fokus på vidareutveckling och det finns generösa möjligheter till kompetensutveckling. Du ska inte behöva byta arbetsgivare för att kunna utvecklas. Vi vet att våra anställda är vår viktigaste nyckel till framgång och därför värdesätter vi på Nexer en långsiktig anställning. Vi vill kunna möta våra konsulter i deras önskemål om utveckling, frågan är inte vad vi har för uppdrag att erbjuda dig som konsult utan vad du som konsult skulle vilja jobba med hos oss.
   Ansökan
   Du är hjärtligt välkommen att skicka din ansökan här nedan. Vi har tyvärr ingen möjlighet att ta emot ansökningar via e-post men har du frågor om tjänsten eller Nexer är du varmt välkommen att höra av dig till ansvarig rekryterare Petra Sivefäldt på petra.sivefaldt@nexergroup.com.

  Vill du vara med och förändra en av världens mest snabbväxande branscher? Learnifier är i en scale-up fas och söker nu flera React-utvecklare som vill vara med på vår resa! Kan det vara du?
   Din roll
   Hos oss kommer du jobba med React i en lösning som används av hundratusentals personer. Produkten Learnifier är stor och det finns mycket funktionalitet på plats. Trots det så vill vi att produkten ska göra mycket mer, samtidigt som vissa äldre delar behöver förbättras så att de blir ännu vassare efter våra kunders feedback.
   Du kommer jobba i ett Engineering-team bestående av backendutvecklare, frontendutvecklare samt ux-designer.
   Våran teknikstack använder bland annat: AWS (EC2), Java-lösning som backend, Jenkins, Git, Bootstrap, React.
   Vem vi tror du är

    Du har 3-5 års arbetserfarenhet.

   Du har jobbat med modern React och är bekväm med ramverket. Nyare funktioner som hooks och context är något som du hanterar utan problem. 
   Du tycker att HTML och CSS är fundament i din kompetens och du förstår båda väl. Att använda flex för att positionera objekt är något du kan och gillar. 
   Du behöver inte vara formgivare men har ändå en bra känsla för design och ux och anser att det är de små detaljerna som tar en lösning från bra till jättebra. Eftersom du jobbar med produktutveckling så kommer dina resultat leva länge. 
   Du har erfarenheter med att jobba med gridlösningar (vi jobbar med Bootstrap) och tycker att de är nyttiga och du tänker gärna mobile first. 
   Du kan kommunicera väl både skriftligt och i tal på engelska. Svenska är inget krav men underlättar.

   Learnifier är en scale-up inom Educational Technology, ofta kallat EdTech, som idag är en av de snabbast växande branscherna i världen. Vi har skapat ett digitalt verktyg som hjälper verksamheter att dela kunskap på ett så enkelt och smidigt vis som möjligt.

    Att få komma in i ett tidigt skede med möjlighet att påverka bolagets utveckling.

   På det professionella planet kan vi säga att vi är tech, tillväxt och innovation, allt stöpt i en form där vi älskar e-handel. På det personliga planet är vi drygt 50 personer som trivs ihop, jobbar för att utveckla oss själva, de bolag vi arbetar med och mellan varven tar en AW när vi känner att det behövs.
   C.A.G Ateles är ett bolag som hela tiden utvecklas och förändras. Vi söker dig som vill vara här, vill jobba tillsammans med oss och som vill vara med och bygga vår gemensamma arbetsplats. Vi är en del av C.A.G Group AB.

   För att arbeta strukturerat och effektivt tillhör du ett mindre team och följer agila utvecklingsmetoder. Arbetet sker främst i projektform, vanligtvis under 6-12 månader, med många releaser på vägen och där du snabbt ser resultatet av ditt arbete i kundernas webbshoppar. 
  När du är redo för en större utmaning finns många möjligheter, exempelvis som Scrum Master eller Tech Lead inom teamet.

Du har en stark ansvarskänsla, driv och flera års erfarenhet som utvecklare. I arbetet är du handlingskraftig och leder genom att vara ett gott föredöme.

Frontendutvecklare till Äventyret,Ants,120 30 StockholmDistans,"Du älskar att koda. Och om du får välja så fokuserar du på gränssnittet eftersom du uppskattar interaktionsdesign och snygg form. Det är hos dig “teorin” för digitala gränssnitt kommer till liv.
På Äventyret vill vi komma till skott så snart som möjligt och är lite otåliga med pappersexercisen. Google sorterar in oss som “affärsutvecklare” och det är inte helt dumt — vi är teknikagnostiker som är intresserade av effekten av vad vi tar fram åt våra beställare. Med det sagt trillar våra lösningar alltid ut i digitala format såsom appar, inloggade tjänster på webben, teknikekosystem, digitaliseringsprospekt, prototyper för nya affärsgrenar etc.
Vilka är Äventyret?
Vi är utvecklare, konceptutvecklare, designers, problemlösare, arkitekter, affärsutvecklare och UI-kreatörer. Flera miljoner människor har använt de produkter och tjänster som vi har utvecklat för våra kunder. Dessa kunder kan nu erbjuda bättre nytta till sina användare, framtidssäkra sina organisationer och tjäna pengar på bättre sätt.

Våra anställda arbetar på Äventyrets kontor i Stockholm, på vårt kontor i Örebro eller någon annanstans där det finns internetuppkoppling. Vi har dessutom kunskapsdelningar och såklart konferenser – för hela Äventyret.
Att jobba som frontendutvecklare på Äventyret
Det är rimligt att vara med i 2-3 projektteam parallellt, och du växlar ditt fokus mellan dessa under en vanlig arbetsvecka. Projekten på Äventyret är nästan alltid från ax till limpa. För att limpan ska smaka riktigt gott är det viktigt att du som utvecklare är med även i idé- och konceptfas. Projekten blir bäst med löpande inspel från hela teamet, över alla dess faser. Ni bestämmer själva vad som ska göras/byggas/fortbildas utan krav på projektleverabler och kompetensteam för interna förbättringar sätts upp på egna initiativ.
Vem är du då?
Du säger check på följande fyra punkter:

Du har jobbat med Javascript i några år och skapar högpresterande, tight och snygg kod.
Du är grym på HTML, CSS och skriver modulär frontendkod som hjälper till att komponentifiera gränssnittet.
Du överjobbar inte en prototyp som ska slängas efter ett första användningstest. Och du fuskar inte heller med produktionskod.
Du har gjort minst ett (lyckat) projekt i React, Vue eller varför inte Svelte.
Du kanske inte tycker dig ha 100% på alla andra punkter ovan — men du kan en massa annat bra. Du är framförallt hungrig på att lära dig nytt i en prestigelös atmosfär. Du kan lite svenska. I brist på lite svenska kan du bra engelska. Du kan uttrycka dig i skrift.
Är du redo för Äventyret?
Ansök redan idag då intervjuer sker löpande. Vid frågor eller mer information kontakta Klara Himmelstrand på +46 72-050 78 44 eller klara.himmelstrand@aventyret.com",https://se.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appsharedroid&jk=5932542a000bc388

Vi håller en kompetensmässigt hög nivå och många av oss har arbetat länge inom frontend och det finns därför stora möjligheter att lära av varandra. Vi brukar träffas på kontoret regelbundet för att gå igenom våra egna projekt och diskutera det senaste inom frontend. Dessa träffar avslutar vi alltid med att testa en ny teknik eller metod som vi tycker är intressant. Som en del av detta team får du alltid stor möjlighet att själv påverka inte bara vilket uppdrag du arbetar med utan vilka tekniker du vill fokusera på, och utvecklas inom.
Tillhörighet är viktigt för oss och detta arbetar vi med kontinuerligt genom sociala aktiviteter, kompetensutveckling och annat som syftar till att öka trivseln inom gruppen. Du har en nära kontakt med din chef som hela tiden arbetar för att du ska få ett så utmanande och utvecklande uppdrag som möjligt.

Din bakgrund

Sist men inte minst, vi vill att du skall fortsätta att utvecklas och ha kul på jobbet!

Varför Nexer?
Inom Nexer finns det en uttalad utmaning som genomsyrar alla uppdrag och företaget som helhet: finns det en smartare lösning så hittar vi den. En strävan som varje dag utmanar oss och låter oss att tänka utanför de givna ramarna och tillsammans med våra kunder ta de modiga beslut som krävs för att skapa utveckling.
Vi erbjuder problemlösning, allt från att utveckla ett nytt system till att designa en webbshop eller något annat där vår breda och spetsiga kompetens inom teknik kommer till sin rätt. Våra uppdrag har ofta internationell karaktär, därför är flytande svenska och engelska i tal och skrift är en naturlig del i arbetet. Konsultuppdragen finns dels på vårt kontor och oftast hos våra kunder, därför är resor i närområdet en del av vardagen.

Full Stack Developer,SeenThis,120 32 StockholmDistans,"
  Full Stack Developer
   Would you call yourself a “Full Stack” developer? Do you have 2+ years of professional experience in JavaScript, Node.js and modern frameworks like Vue.js and React?
   Do you aspire to work in a smaller, but growing company that values flexibility, fast-forwardness, and having fun along the ride? 
  Then this is a great opportunity to join our talented team of 11 engineers in Stockholm. 
  Our tech team is developing state of the art streaming technology for video and images. As a Full Stack developer at SeenThis, you will work with both internal and client facing tools and applications, to help our product reach its full potential.
   Expect to grow and be challenged!
  
   About SeenThis
   Since 2017, SeenThis has been evolving screen experiences for everyone, everywhere. With our groundbreaking adaptive streaming technology, we are transforming the distribution of digital content, to increase performance and reduce impact on the climate.
   With billions of streams served for more than 1,000 brands in over 40 countries, we push petabytes of data through our systems each month. If you’re wondering about requests per second, we’ll tell you over a Zoom coffee.
   We are on a journey to reshape the internet — for good. And the X factor to this success is our people. 
  We are a tight-knit team of 100+ employees working across the globe from our offices in Stockholm, Oslo, Copenhagen, London, Paris, Singapore, New York, and Sydney. We’re growing at a rapid pace, across all business areas, and are constantly looking for new colleagues to join our team. 
  We hire the best people and believe in their ability to create success and grow at the same time. We are global, yet close to heart – and we have ambitious goals, yet down-to-earth people.
   Do you want to be part of our expansion journey and have a lot of fun along the ride?
   We offer you:
   
   The opportunity to grow with a Swedish tech company 
   To learn and get support from experienced colleagues, enjoy hackathons and great discussions by the coffee machine 
   To work with state of the art technology 
   Great compensation for great work 
   A flexible workplace with a remote hybrid policy, and a social HQ office by the water, close to Södermalm in Stockholm 
  
  
   
  About the role
   Your work here will help establish our streaming technology as the new standard for delivering videos and images on the web – to deliver content faster, using less data, and in higher quality. If you’re thinking about the “middle out compression” joke from Silicon Valley, you’re not the first. We’re also big fans of Aviato and Erlich Bachman.
   We are currently hiring several developers to our applications team, to optimize and keep adding new functionalities to our CMS as well as our client-facing applications “Video Drop” & “Image Drop”. That means you will both work on our internal tools, where creative solutions and fast implementation is key, as well as on our external client-facing applications where design and usability are of high importance. 
  Our stack is JavaScript-based with Node.js, and we are using mostly Vue.js and (some) React.js for frontend. The communication between our frontends and backends is mostly through GraphQL and REST APIs.
   Your work task will be varied and will most probably involve things from all across the stack. This is a great opportunity to learn and develop in several areas that you are interested in!
   Do you have the ambition to take a Team Lead role in the future? Great! As the teams are growing, we are strongly encouraging those who want to help take responsibility for others.

Full Stack Engineer,Quizrr,120 30 StockholmDistans,"If we flip the labels in our clothing or coffee cups or 100 different items on our desks, we would read, “Made in Bangladesh”, “Made in China” or “Made in Thailand”. But have we really wondered about the real hands that made those products in the tail end of supply chains of global manufacturing companies?
If we say, the quality and safety of such work environments in global downstream manufacturing hotspots are often poor, you probably wouldn’t even be surprised.
But we bet you would be surprised if we say, you could reduce the number of occupational accidents in factories in Bangladesh sitting from our office in Stockholm.
Or you might be even more surprised to hear that you could actively fight modern slavery and bonded labour across Asia, if you choose to join our team.
Who are we?
We are Quizrr - an EdTech pioneer in social sustainability. We use the bottom up approach to help companies unleash human capital in global supply chains.
Our path to impact is to create relevant engaging content to spread knowledge and understanding of key topics like occupational health & safety, basic human rights, ethical recruitment practices and much more. To date, we have over 500 factories using our digital training platform and a humbling 970 000+ sessions played by people ranging from migrant workers in arrival centers to production lines across Asia. Measurable, engaging & also purposeful!
Why do we need this?
We have a chance to improve the quality of work and life for millions of workers who make the things that surround us everyday.
The training modules that we design, develop and deploy through our platform increases retention and employee satisfaction for our factories thereby reducing the cost of recruitment and training.
The retail giants in Europe and US demand their manufacturing counterparts in these developing countries to ensure quality of work life which we help deliver. So it's a win-win-win!
But we are just getting started. This year will be a pivotal year as we expand into more countries, explore new markets and take our product to the next level. This is why we are asking you to join our team.
Who are we looking for?
You are a person with a big heart and a passion for coding. You want to use your skills and knowledge to create change and build the capacity of millions of workers in supply chains around the world. You enjoy working in an international environment and be part of an innovative and expanding company. You want to be a key player of a great and growing team, having influence over what we do and how we do it. Most importantly you have high ambitions and like to have lots of fun.
What your days will look like
Implementing key features in our training platforms
Collaborate with our growing team of developers to continuously improve software and business processes by using innovative tools and techniques
Playing a key role in our product innovation discussions
Knowing that your everyday work will improve working conditions for factory workers around the globe
Being part of a creative and fast-moving team in Stockholm
Requirements
3+ years of real world experience of software development in JavaScript (ES6+)

Experience with Node.js backends with MongoDB (or other NoSQL databases)
Experience in React or similar frameworks
English (we are an international team)
Bonus
An interest or experience with other parts of development process, like DevOps.

Why join us?
Impact: Every day you work with Quizrr, we are making somebody’s life and work in another part of the world better.

  COVID-19 Considerations 
  We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. In many locations, which may change over time, we’ve implemented a virtual hiring process and continue to interview candidates by video or phone. In addition, in some locations, only individuals who have been fully vaccinated will be permitted inside Mastercard offices until further notice. 
  
  In the US, Mastercard is a government contractor, which may legally require most Mastercard employees to be vaccinated unless a verified approved medical or religious exemption is granted. Further, we are currently making every effort towards having employees return to work in the office 2 days per week, if that makes sense for their team. Everyone must be vaccinated to enter Mastercard offices at this time. Therefore, we expect all candidates to be vaccinated or to be approved for a medical or religious accommodation prior to commencing work at Mastercard. 
  
  Corporate Security Responsibility  All activities involving access to Mastercard assets, information, and networks comes with an inherent risk to the organization and, therefore, it is expected that every person working for, or on behalf of, Mastercard is responsible for information security and must: 
  
   Abide by Mastercard’s security policies and practices; 
   Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the information being accessed; 
   Report any suspected information security violation or breach, and 
   Complete all periodic mandatory security trainings in accordance with Mastercard’s guidelines.

To do that we're investing heavily into creating a Commerce Platform as we reimagine the capabilities we need to best serve Spotify's current and future commerce goals.

But that is only the start. How do you build a flexible platform to power the lofty products that people around Spotify want to build? How do you create systems that bring the buyer and the seller together so that fans are purchasing directly from creators? How do you support buyers and sellers through their issues, whenever they need help? How do you do these things in a safe, reliable way for everyone involved? How do you abstract away the intricacies of global financial regulation without creating barriers? And how do you make it easy?

Establish and enact good practices for a safe, scalable, and reliable platform
Work day-to-day with a broad range of incredibly talented people from product, design, writing, finance, accounting, legal, customer service, and more
Who you are
You have experience or background in web development with Javascript/Typescript (React), HTML, and CSS
You are experienced in integrating APIs and client libraries used by multiple engineering teams and have worked with protocols like gRPC, REST GraphQL
You are comfortable building while product definition and designs are being determined
You like to build skills to further grow into data and backend engineering
You have a high-quality attitude and you aim to deliver clear and maintainable code
You value team success over personal success
You know and care about sound engineering practices like continuous delivery, defensive programming, and automated testing.

Joining a company early is exciting, not only will you be part of defining the vision, as one of our first employees, you will receive a competitive package, including a stock option program, personal training budget, and much more. 
  Your mission:
   
   Write testable, maintainable and scalable code and always with a quality mindset 
   Continuously optimise and iterate on your ideas and solutions, and always strive for even better performance and user experience 
   Be ready to embrace new technologies and paradigms as we move Proposales into a serverless era 
   Join us in shaping our engineering culture to make Proposales a place you look forward to in the morning 
  
  What we believe in:
   We use a serverless, continuous-delivery infrastructure hosted on Vercel, built using Next.js and written in TypeScript.
   
  When deciding on a tech stack for a new sub-project, we usually take the opportunity to assess new tech early and plan for long-term benefits and maintainability over short-term goals. But we also value simple solutions over smart ones, and embrace test-driven development and pair programming, favoring higher code quality over faster development times.
   
  We generally prefer a functional programming style over object-orientation and like to avoid abstractions like middlewares or ORMs.
   
  We prefer monorepos with multiple smaller projects, instead of one monolithic application. We avoid code duplication by extracting core logic and UI into separate internal libraries.
   Some of the technologies you would be working with:
   
   Javascript 
   React 
   Node.js 
   Next.js 
   TypeScript

As part of Neo4j product engineering, you will work together with a diverse team of talented colleagues from around the world. Our culture encourages engineers who want to become deep experts in a particular field – or to build broad expertise across several technologies. Our engineers regularly work with peers in field engineering and experience the full lifecycle of the systems they build.
We build technology that helps cure cancers, addresses diabetes, and gets humans to Mars. We're proud to fight fraud, crush pandemics, and even help journalists uncover the truth. Neo4j’s engineering teams are located in Malmö, Sweden and London, UK.
Please submit your CV and cover letter in English.
The Role

At Neo4j, we believe that graph databases are the optimal backend for GraphQL APIs. Come and help us realize that vision by joining our GraphQL team!

As well as your core work in the team, you will be encouraged to write blogs and articles, assist with training and community events, and speak at conferences and meetups. You will also be given plenty of time and space to innovate, with up to 25% of your time available to work on some of those crazy ideas you’ve been dreaming up.
You’ll be based in either our engineering HQ in Malmö, Sweden or our office in London, and will travel on occasion between the two. This can of course be mixed with working from home in a balance that works for you. Expect to be pairing and joining design discussions using online collaboration software on a regular basis.
At Neo4j, you’ll work in a fun and flexible environment alongside an exceptional international team. If we sound like a good match, then get in touch and tell us about yourself.
What You'll Do:
Maintain and improve existing Neo4j GraphQL integrations
Design and build new services to enhance the Neo4j GraphQL experience
Design and build amazing front-end experiences using the Neo4j GraphQL integrations
Participate in the full software development lifecycle, including support

A desire to write high-quality, well tested code

Innovation och produktutveckling finns i vårt DNA. Nu vill vi stärka upp vårt innovationsteam i Karlshamn med ytterligare en Fullstackutvecklare, kanske är det du? Välkommen till Avalon Innovation!
Din framtida utmaning
Avalon Innovation är ett branschoberoende teknikkonsultbolag som har utvecklat hållbara och spännande tekniklösningar i snart 25 år. Innovation och produktutveckling finns i vårt DNA.
Att vara konsult på Avalon innebär att du både kan ha ett uppdrag på plats hos någon av våra kunder eller jobba i ett inhouse-projekt från Avalons kontor i Karlshamn.


Vill du ha en vardag som är fylld av möjligheter, kluriga utmaningar, tekniksnack och intressanta samarbetspartners? Tillsammans skapar vi hållbara och innovativa lösningar som gör skillnad på riktigt och där ditt bidrag är avgörande. Din roll kommer att innebära att du är med och tekniskt analyserar krav samt tar fram design och implementation utifrån dessa. Som team kommer ni också att felsöka och optimera ny samt befintlig kodbas. Automatisering och förbättringar av processer och metodik kan vara en del av uppdragen för att öka kvalitet och stabiliteten på framtagna lösningar. Därför tror vi att ständiga förbättringar är något som motiverar dig. Du ser ett värde i dokumentation av din kod och det är en naturlig del av ditt arbete.
Hos Avalon backas du av 150 ingenjörer som aldrig är längre bort än ett telefonsamtal. Vi vill att du ska må bra, utvecklas och vilja brainstorma fram nästa stora idé. Vi arbetar flexibelt och digitalt och hittar former som passar våra kunders utmaningar och behov.
 
Vem du är
Vi söker dig som är erfaren i din roll som fullstackutvecklare och som vill fortsätta din resa tillsammans med oss. Du har en passande utbildning i bagaget och erfarenhet från systemutveckling. Om du dessutom har en multidisciplinär bakgrund inom mjukvara / elektronik / mekanik så är det starkt meriterande. Oavsett bakgrund så är du duktig på att kommunicera och att hålla nära dialog med kunder och leverantörer. Du talar svenska och engelska obehindrat.
När det gäller erfarenheter och kompetenser så inser vi att ingen kan allt, men vi tror att du har god förståelse och kännedom inom några av följande områden:
C/.Net, Java, Python, Javascript, Typescript, React, Vue, Node.
Erfarenhet från backend, frontend eller fullstack.
Erfarenhet av att jobba med databaser
Som kollega är du strukturerad, flexibel och trygg. Du kan förmedla information, besked och riktning på ett sätt som hjälper teamet att nå målet. Vi tror att du befinner dig i Karlshamn, eller inom pendlingsbart avstånd. Även om de flesta av våra nuvarande uppdrag är inhouse-projekt, så bör du vara bekväm med att pendla till ett uppdrag hos någon av våra kunder.
Gillar du långa promenader, nörda ner dig i oväsentliga prylar samt att ta en afterwork med dina kollegor då kommer vi komma bra överens. Om du dessutom gillar stark gemenskap, torra skämt och en solig balkong att hänga på, då är vi en match made in heaven.
Vi ser fram emot att träffa dig, så vänta inte med att skicka in din ansökan!
Vilka vi är
Avalon Innovation är ett skandinaviskt konsultföretag som utvecklar innovativa produkt- och systemlösningar.

Fullstack Developer,Knightec,Stockholm,"Why should you want this job?
Your inner motivation lies within solving technical problems and creating products and services as a team, and you jump at the opportunity to learn something from your peers. All code is reviewed, fast decision paths and great freedom allow you to develop your skills.
The team is self-managed, so how you solve the problem is up to you. You and your team will pick the technologies needed to solve the task, not the other way around.
What it all boils down to is that we want you to give you the possibility to only focus on what you love the most, solving technical problems.
Build a career to be proud of
All our projects, whether it is regarding self-driving vehicles, a medical technology solution to fight cancer, or a streaming service, have one thing in common, they are all built on cloud technology.
Mob programming, code review, tech talks, hackathons, and certifications are some of the ways we can get even better together. That's what it's about, achieving things together.
You are surrounded by people that care. Not just about the project and technology, but about each other. We do it as a team; that's the way forward.
Skills needed
We believe that you have been working with the client-side of systems for a while, developing admin webs, making the systems usable and convenient for the users. Nonetheless, you get just as excited when getting to work backend to keep up to date with state-of-the-art technologies on the server-side of the application.
We believe you feel comfortable with our tech stack, which contains (but not exclusively):

Languages and frameworks – HTML5: JavaScript, TypeScript CSS3, WebSockets, React, and Angular.
Orchestration - Serverless and Docker.
Nice to have, but not a requirement, would be if you have experience of cloud services – AWS, Amazon, or GCP.

  Who we are
   Reason Studios have been pioneers in the music industry since the dawn of the classic loop editor ReCycle and ReBirth, which emulated the TB-303 Roland Bass Line and TR-808 Drum Machine hardware. Our software has played a crucial role in electronic music and hiphop ever since then.
   We at Reason Studios are passionate about music. The office is often buzzing with discussions about beats, tunes and music making. Ever so often you will see somebody - visiting artists or one of our employees - cranking out tunes in our own music studio.
   Our passion for music also means we have close relationships with our end-users and regularly interact with musicians and producers world-wide. We want to make it easier for them to make great music.
   We are respected in the industry, but still a small, yet independent team. This means that you instantly become an important part in our mission to reimagine the music making.
   About the role 
  We are now looking for our next Full Stack Developer to join our platform-team. You will be a part of an autonomous team of four senior developers and a product owner. Your responsibilities will include planning, designing and shaping Reason Studio’s web services as well as maintaining and improving the existing infrastructure. You will work with both front-end and back-end development with Python and JavaScript. The role also includes initiation and managing of technical projects which means communicating with several departments concerning overlapping tech solutions.
   At Reason Studios, we value teamwork and collaboration, and you will get the opportunity to be a part of the big change happening at Reason right now. We can’t wait to hear what ideas you have and how you can contribute to making Reason the first hand choice when it comes to software for music development.
   Who are you?  To feel comfortable in this role, you’ve probably worked as a fullstack developer for a couple of years. You need to be comfortable in both spoken and written English.
   We think you have experience with:
   
   Python 
   JavaScript/TypeScript 
   Micro services 
  
  It is advantageous if you have experience with:
   
   Databases 
   Cloud platforms 
   Security within applications and infrastructure 
   Python & Django 
  
  Furthermore, we believe that you are a team player and that you are not afraid to admit your mistakes or to change to a better solution that comes along. At Reason Studios you are encouraged to take initiatives and to continuously improve and develop yourself. You take a big responsibility in your daily work and you always aim at making things better and smoother. You enjoy making a difference.
   Why should you join us? 
  We know what sparks innovation, and therefore we have many means of letting our employees explore new routes, work on a solution they are excited about – or simply spend time on that dream project.  Being part of our team also means getting a chance to work with advanced technical architecture, state of the art digital signal processing and the latest in digital marketing. And working with engaged and talented people in an inspiring and vibrant atmosphere!  If you’re passionate about music and restless for new ideas, we’re ready to take you where you want to go—and beyond.

Join one of our teams working on a project for tech company, spun out of the largest coliving operator in Sweden as of 2021. Being part of an operator gave us insights how complex and demanding it is to manage a shared living business. During the past three years we have developed and validated a questionnaire with our own psychologist, that creates a personality and values profile of the tenant, and a matching algorithm to help us match tenants into the best suited shared living environment. We are now going to provide the questionnaire and matching engine as a platform with two different interfaces: one for operators who simply want to use the product standalone to administrate questionnaires, see tenant profiles and match tenants through a simple web interface and one for operators and other platforms that want to integrate the solution into their own application flow or systems. Our mission is to enable the best shared living experience by building and providing a platform that provides operators with the best tenant insights that technology can provide.
Your role

Platformising: Our product will serve multiple operators in different regions – we need an infrastructure that can help enable this (SaaS platform)
Open APIs: Our product will also be distributed as an API product, which means we need to take the perspective of developers as our customers as well
Testing: We are a small team, which means that each and every one of us needs to shoulder different roles – testing and QA is part of that
First team: We are not only a small team. You will actually be joining the only team - this means that we will tackle company opportunities (and problems) as one unit
Your skills
At least 4 years of experience as a Fullstack Developer (web and back-end)
Our back-end is in Node.js and Typescript and we need someone who is fluent in those languages

Fullstack Javascript Developer with front end focus,Anyfin,111 36 Stockholm,"Who we are
Since our start in 2017 we have provided smart tools that help put financial power back in the hands of the people – where we believe it belongs. Everything we do is based on one vision: to improve the world’s financial health.
So far, we’ve helped Swedes, Finns and Germans save millions by refinancing expensive consumer credits. But we aim higher. New markets, new tools, new products and new ways of improving people’s financial lives. This means we need more brains and hearts to fuel our growth. That is why we are currently searching for a Fullstack developer with front end focus.
Joining Anyfin as a Fullstack JavaScript Developer means that you will have the opportunity to work in a startup company in constant movement, where tech constitutes the very core of our business. You will join a highly technical (and super friendly) team where you will be part of solving the financial issues of tomorrow. We are building the foundations of something truly big, so skills in writing clean and readable code will come in handy. If you want to work in a fast paced environment, and also get to contribute to the well-being of our customers - you might be the one we’re looking for!

What you will be doing
In this role you will be working on complex coding challenges, building new products and creating features to our existing products. You will also work on communication gateways to our customer facing web and native apps. To do so your tools will be React and React Native along with Typescript, Node, GraphQL and Postgres. You will get the opportunity to contribute to the system and product design so an open and curious mind is key. The job also means to own critical parts of what you are building. At Anyfin we work in cross functional teams so you’ll get the chance to work with friendly and competent people from all kinds of areas. You’ll be sharing knowledge, best practices and guidelines with the rest of the company.
Who you are
You have great skills in JavaScript and have a preference for React since that is what we are heavily leaning towards. We would be thrilled if you also happen to have experience in Python, GO or SQL, but if you don’t that’s okay too. We believe that you have at least three years of professional experience.
Since we move at a fast pace,- it is important that you can find the right balance between perfecting code and what is required at the time. And lastly, but just as important as your skills in Javascript, you have an open mind and like people for what they are. We value a workplace where everyone is respected for who they are, no matter their gender, age, sexual orientation or religion. We hope you do too.

We offer you the chance to be part of something truly amazing. With strong backers and a world class team there is no limit to what we can achieve together.

We promise that you will be challenged, pushed to develop your skill set and get the opportunity to work alongside amazing and smart colleagues.

While we've had a good run so far it is what lies ahead that excites everyone that works here, and we are just getting started. Then there is the compensation package, centrally located cozy office, extra time off on your birthday and a bunch of other benefits as well. But we will get to all that in due time.

Du blir en del av ett projektteam där du omges av kompetenta medarbetare. Tillsammans tar ni er an projekt, som exempelvis kan innebära att utveckla i någon av våra produktmiljöer eller bygga en onlineplattform för någon av våra kunder. Då vi har en bred variation på våra kunder, finns möjligheten att fördjupa sig inom något teknikområde. 
     Utvecklingen sker bland annat i följande miljöer: 
     
     Server: Java, Spring, Netflix OSS, REST, Microservices 
     Klient: JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, REST 
     Verktyg: Git, Gradle, npm 
     
    Hos oss på LeanOn får du möjlighet till en varierad och utvecklande roll genom våra tre inriktningar; produkter, interna kundprojekt och konsultuppdrag hos våra kunder. Vad som blir ditt nästa projekt är du själv med och påverkar. 
     Vem vi söker 
     För att lyckas som utvecklare hos oss tycker du att det är roligt med komplex systemutveckling och du trivs med att arbeta såväl självständigt som tillsammans med andra i projekt. Du har förmågan att kunna prioritera bland dina uppgifter och är mån om att säkerställa en hög kvalité i det arbetet du lämnar ifrån dig. Att bidra med dina kunskaper såväl som att ta till dig ny kunskap från andra är en självklarhet för dig. På LeanOn finns en positiv inställning och vi tror att du, precis som vi, väljer att se lösningar och möjligheter i stället för problem. 
     Tekniskt sett ser vi framför oss att du är erfaren inom: 
     
     Java 
     Microservices-arkitektur 
     Frontend-utveckling med JavaScript, framförallt inom ramverket React 
     
    Beroende på erfarenhet och ditt engagemang anpassas uppgifterna med målet att du från start eller på sikt kommer kunna ta ett större ansvar i våra projekt för exempelvis teknikval och arkitektur. På LeanOn arbetar vi utifrån visionen att vi bygger bolaget tillsammans och varje individs bidrag är därför viktigt och värderas! 
     Vår arbetsplats 
     Vi erbjuder dig en arbetsplats där trivsel och utveckling alltid står i fokus. Vi investerar i våra medarbetare och erbjuder bland annat individuella kompetensutvecklingsmöjligheter, maximalt friskvårdsbidrag och interna utbildningar. Vi tycker vidare det är viktigt att ha roligt tillsammans och under årets gång genomförs därför flera AW:s och konferensresor samt tillställningar där även familjen är välkommen.

"Fullstack, frontend utvecklare till ESSIQ i Stockholm",ESSIQ,114 38 StockholmDistans,"Du vill bestämma själv!
Du vill kanske göra saker på ditt sätt? (Vanligt resonemang för att bli egenkonsult) :-)
Kanske har du redan provat det och insett att det är ganska skönt att ha en organisation omkring dig som stöttar dig och ser till ditt bästa (ja, klart behöver bolaget också tjäna pengar). Men tjänar du bra och trivs kommer resten på köpet. Tro mig, vi lever efter den filosofin på ESSIQ.
Du är en utvecklare som nu vill leva livet som konsult. Vi erbjuder spännande uppdrag inom framtida branscher som gör skillnad i människors vardag. Visst låter det häftigt (och lite som en kliché)?
Jag vet att du egentligen tycker branschsnack är överskattat och att viktigast är att du får arbete inom just det teknikområdet du brinner för (och att du kan styra din tid och fritid).
Det löser vi!
Vi förstår dig och vårt jobb är att sätta dig och dina behov i främsta rummet så du kan bli en riktig bra ambassadör för oss och med dina spetskompetenser hjälpa bolag runt oss växa och frodas.
Just nu är det högt tryck på Fullstack och Frontend Utvecklare (har du kanske märkt av alla inMail som landar i din linkedIn varje dag).

Fullstackutvecklare,Decerno,Stockholm,"
  Tycker du om att jobba i React, Angular, C# eller .NET? Då borde du läsa vidare.. 
   Vi söker nämligen vår nästa fullstackutvecklare till vårt härliga gäng! Är du en person som är tydlig med omtanke, vågar utforska och pröva samt gillar att skapa värde tillsammans? Då delar du våra värderingar. På Decerno arbetar vi tillsammans för att skapa värde i allt vi gör, både för våra anställda och för våra kunder. Det är något som är med oss i hela processen från början till slut och är en självklarhet i vår vardag. 
   Våra uppdrag – bidra till samhällsnytta 
   Vår nisch är att bygga skräddarsydda digitala lösningar som skapar nya möjligheter, förenklar livet för människor och stärker våra kunders konkurrenskraft - allt utifrån vår kunds specifika behov. Vi riktar in oss på uppdrag där vi tar ett helhetsansvar över projektets framgång och kan bemanna med ett helt team av våra egna anställda. Vi söker nära och långa samarbeten med kund där vi bygger långsiktigt hållbara lösningar. 
   Det som driver Decerno är att göra skillnad. För oss är det viktigt att vi kan bidra till en bättre värld och ett bättre samhälle. Därför har vi en stark etisk policy som guidar oss i våra val av projekt. Vi väljer aktivt bort projekt inom vapenindustrin samt projekt med koppling till alkohol, tobak och spel om pengar. Dessutom siktar vi på att kunna koppla fler av våra projekt till FN:s globala hållbarhetsmål. 
   Rollen 
   Som konsult hos oss kan får du en varierad vardag och möjlighet att jobba inom (men inte uteslutande) med: 
  
   Dina kollegor från Decerno, tillsammans delar ni med er av olika erfarenheter och hjälper varandra genom projektets alla faser – både de svåra och de enklare bitarna – tillsammans skapar vi värde!
   
  
   Varierande projekt, vi hittar det som passar dig bäst!
   
  
   Utveckling, främst i React, .NET/C#, SQL eller Azure
   
   Rollen kan utgå från flera av våra kontor: Stockholm, Uppsala, Malmö eller vårt Virtuella kontor – vilket alternativ hade passat din livssituation bäst? 
   Är det här du? 
   I rollen som konsult ser vi gärna att du har med dig en del erfarenhet in. Därför bör du ha ungefär 3-4 års tidigare erfarenhet av serverprogrammering i .NET/C# och SQL. I frontend är det bra om du tidigare sysslat med React, Vue eller Angular. Det är även ett krav att du är flytande i svenska i både tal och skrift. Högskoleutbildning eller motsvarande erfarenhet ses även det som ett krav. 
   Det ses som meriterande (men inte absolut nödvändigt) om du tidigare har arbetat med Azure, azure devops, integrationer, .net web api eller CSS. Som person tror vi att du kommer trivas bäst om du har tidigare erfarenhet av att arbeta i team och därför kommunicerar enkelt och ärligt med dina kollegor. Tillsammans förstår ni vad kunden är ute efter och översätter det till användarvänliga lösningar för slutanvändaren. 
   Varför du ska välja Decerno 
   I våra medarbetarundersökningar blir det gång på gång tydligt att det är de fantastiska kollegorna, de roliga och utmanande projekten och möjligheten att kunna bidra till samhällsnytta som gör att vi trivs så bra på Decerno. 
   Sedan finns det också några ytterligare aspekter som vi som arbetsgivare ser som självklarheter: 
   
   En flexibel arbetsplats med större frihet att planera vardagen för att få arbete och privatliv att gå ihop 
   Vi erbjuder extra föräldraförmåner för vi tycker att familjen är viktigast 
   Vi tycker att din kompetensutveckling är viktig! Därför anordnar vi interna utbildningar i vår egen Dec Academy och håller årliga konferenser 
   Vi vill att du ska må bra, trivas och ha roligt på arbetet och därför arrangerar vi regelbundet olika sociala aktiviteter, utmaningar och hälsotävlingar – såväl virtuellt som på plats (i vanliga fall) 
   
  Utöver detta erbjuder vi även ett brett förmånspaket som inkluderar bland annat friskvårdsbidrag och försäkringspaket. Vi berättar gärna mer om du vill veta vad mer vi på Decerno skulle kunna erbjuda dig. 
   Låter detta som ditt nästa steg i karriären? 
   Bra, då vill vi ha in din ansökan så snart som möjligt!

   Vi välkomnar en mångfald av sökande med olika bakgrund och ser fram emot att få veta mer om dig och hur vi kan bli en del av ditt nästa steg i karriären. 
   På Decerno är vi ca 130 anställda fördelade på mellan vårt virtuella kontor och våra fysiska kontor i Stockholm, Uppsala, Göteborg, Malmö och Sevilla, Spanien. Vi är måna om vår familjära känsla av ett mindre bolag samtidigt som vi sedan 2010 har haft tryggheten av att vara en del av Addnode Group.

Tillsammans utvecklar vi webbplatser, appar, intranät, webbshoppar, andra digitala lösningar och mycket mer.
Förmåner som gör skillnad
Vi har en go och omtänksam stämning på Triggerfish. Vi gillar att jobba ihop på kontoret men det går givetvis bra att köra hemifrån. Dessutom får du:

5 000:- i friskvårdsbidrag
30 dagars semester
Minst en resa varje år till en spännande plats
Seniort projektledarteam
Kreativa och prestigelösa medarbetare
Utbildningar som breddar kunskaper och personlig utveckling

Vi vill att du är nyfiken och gillar att kolla upp och lära dig nya saker så att både du och Triggerfish hela tiden blir bättre. Du är en skicklig och noggrann utvecklare, gärna fullstack(vi gör ofta olika integrationer), som gillar långsiktiga och bra lösningar som faktiskt gör nytta och funkar. Vi vill att du har minst tre års erfarenhet av utveckling och att du kan WordPress eller åtminstone PHP och har gedigen erfarenhet av Javascript, React och gärna headlessprojekt.

Vi gillar att du är med och bidrar till vårt tighta team som lägger mycket tid på att tillsammans förbättra vår setup, testa nya grejer och hitta nya verktyg som utmanar och utvecklar oss. Vi gillar WordPress (så det är bra om du har några års erfarenhet av det) även om det är långt ifrån all utveckling som sker i WordPress, vi gör även utveckling som är oberoende av CMS.
Teknik
I vardagen som utvecklare jobbar vi bland annat med Javascript och PHP. Vi gillar Composer, deployar med Ansible, använder mer än gärna helpers från Laravel och tycker det är kul med DevOps. Givetvis versionshanterar vi med Git, och hostar på GitHub.

Vi ser även gärna att du har erfarenhet av något modernt ramverk/bibliotek för Javascript, många av våra projekt inkluderar React. Annat intressant du kan ha jobbat med; objektorienterad programmering, e-handel/WooCommerce.

Vi lägger stor vikt vid personlighet och egenskaper utöver kompetens. Du behöver inte kunna allt vi nämner här men vi uppskattar att du nyfiken och har en konstant vilja att utvecklas och lära dig nya saker.",https://se.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appsharedroid&jk=7f4c6736b7ffbdcf

Vi strävar efter att arbeta i helt autonoma team och trivs inte i hierarkiska strukturer. Saker som ligger oss varmt om hjärtat är kundupplevelse, kontinuerligt lärande och kamratskap.

   Social miljö: Balansen mellan arbete och privatliv är viktigt för oss, därför sköts arbete under arbetstid. Vi trivs med varandra och försöker träffas så ofta vi kan. Något som vi just nu gör (som är valfritt att delta på såklart) är att gå på konferenser, arrangera hackathon, träna tillsammans och träffas på after work.

"Hungry Fullstack Developer (C#. NET, React)",Lime Go,StockholmDistans,"
  What we’re looking for & our journey ahead
   A driven fullstack developer that wants to join our team and help us on our journey to become the most user-friendly and intuitive CRM system in Europe. Lime is the market leader in the Nordics in regard to CRM. Now Lime Go will become its own company operating aside from the Lime Group.
  
   What does this mean for you?
  
    Unique opportunity to join a startup, without financial risk
    An awesome product portfolio and a clean tech stack
    We will have the flexibility and speed of a startup, but a huge advantage, since we’re backed by Lime Technologies
    A lot of freedom and you can shape the product we build
  
  
   Lime Go is a Swedish CRM system and a smart sales tool for small and medium-sized businesses. Currently, we have 1600 customers in Sweden, Norway & Denmark but our end goal is to become the obvious CRM-choice for ambitious companies in Europe.
  
   The tech-stack
   We’ve recently finished a 2-year redesign project which means you’ll deep dive into a completely rewritten, well-organized, and clean codebase. See pictures on our company site here on The Hub to compare!
  
   The frontend is written with the latest versions of React and Redux with a high focus on UX/UI. Therefore, we value your skills as follows:
   Must have: Javascript
   Should have: React (with hooks!)
   Nice to have: Redux & UX/UI experience
  
   The backend. Must have’s:
  
    Designing, developing and deploying web apps and APIs written in C# (.NET 4.7.2, .NET Core, .NET 5).
    Relational database design and writing of optimized SQL queries. Bonus: If in Postgres.
  
  
   Bonus, nice-to-have experience:
  
    Redis for caching
    Designing and developing in Elasticsearch.
    Infrastructure automation using Terraform.
    AWS (EC2, ECS, RDS Postgres, Lambdas, SQS, OpsWorks with Chef)
    Building web apps with event sourcing and CQRS
    Python and/or Ruby
    A huge plus is knowledge within the architecture of SaaS services, DevOps or CI/CD.
  
  
   Take a look at the journey the past two years by googling Lime Go + pictures (It's not possible to add links here)
  
   The team today‍‍‍
   We are a small, ambitious, and autonomous development team with a backend developer (Philippos), a frontend developer (Charlie), and our CEO (Max). You will get a lot of freedom and we guarantee no code monkey business. We have the ambition to become a team of 7-8 developers within a couple of years. It’s an ambitious goal but we have all the tools to succeed and we’d love to have you onboard as a key part of our team.
   Aside from the dev team, we have a fully operational sales, support & marketing organization distributing our product to new users every day. We have the ambition to more than double the size of the dev team within one year.
   At Lime (similar to all other development companies) we work with a development process. If you truly are curious about this we will tell you but let’s not bore you with those details in this ad. Since we’re a small team you’ll be able to shape and affect what we develop!
   Oh, and every 6th week we have a Tuesday Hackathon where you can do whatever you like :)
  
   Your tasks being a part of our team
   As a fullstack developer in the Go team, you will constantly be working with improving the UI, listening closely to users' wants and needs to determine the highest value features. Lime Go contains a lot of data, has a wide variety of customers, and supports high customizability, making it a fun and challenging product to work with.
   Some of the upcoming things we will focus on are integrating new third-party data sources, ERP systems, credit card billing, import tools, and calendar integrations. While at the same time continuously improving workflows and customizability to make our customers even more efficient.
   You will also have the possibility to integrate Lime Go to other products within the Lime portfolio (we’ve acquired 6 companies over the past years).
  
   Where?
   The Product Manager is located in Stockholm and the developers are in Lund. We’ve got offices in Lund, Stockholm, Gothenburg & Gävle. Not to mention Norway, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Germany, and soon Poland. We do enjoy meeting physically and having discussions with a whiteboard and talking nonsense over a cup of freshly brewed Columbian coffee. You can stroll into the office you prefer! However, we’re open to a hybrid/remote role if that is something you value!
  
   Who are we and why Lime?
   Your code will affect thousands of businesses and it will help them save time through smart processes, automation and enable them to become a more efficient sales organization. Apart from every six-week hack Tuesday we have a yearly hackathon where all of Lime’s employees participate from different departments. PS. Some of the most appreciated features in the Lime portfolio are products of the Hackathons!
   We also have generous employee benefits such as company trips, team trips, six weeks of vacation, pension, monthly pubs, being a part of employer branding or recruitment, Lime Go merch (coming soon), wellness allowance, allocated budget for personal development, and the opportunity to join one SaaS event yearly sponsored by Lime.
   During the ride, we’ll have a good laugh and do a bunch of team activities. Apply now to join our journey, Europe awaits!
  
   The process, step by step
   We don’t have a deadline for this role so please feel free to apply whenever!
  
    First off, you’ll get on a screening call with a person on the team. You might also meet one or multiple members of the team
    Then you’ll get a technical assignment to show off your skills. Or send us your code.
    After that, you will have a more in-depth interview with our (Head of Engineering). Physically, if possible.
    Last but not least, you get to meet our Lime Group CEO (Nils).
  
  
   Every employee at Lime has their final interview with Nils because at Lime we want to know each other. Why? Since you spend most of your time at work and therefore, we value fun and challenging times with your colleagues. If possible, we want to combine some of the steps above into one batch, so you’ll become a Limer as fast as you want!
  
   Don’t hesitate to drop your application or reach out to us if you have any questions. See you soon :)
   Let’s GO!

Intresse för frontend-utveckling?,Decerno,Göteborg,"Tycker du om att jobba i React, Angular eller Typescript? Då borde du läsa vidare.

Vi söker nämligen vår nästa frontendutvecklare till vårt härliga gäng! Är du en person som tycker det är viktigt med respektfull kommunikation, vågar utforska och pröva samt gillar att skapa värde tillsammans? Då delar du våra värderingar. På Decerno arbetar vi tillsammans för att skapa värde i allt vi gör, både för våra anställda och för våra kunder. Det är något som är med oss i hela processen från början till slut och är en självklarhet i vår vardag.

Våra uppdrag – bidra till samhällsnytta

Vår nisch är att bygga skräddarsydda digitala lösningar som skapar nya möjligheter, förenklar livet för människor och stärker våra kunders konkurrenskraft - allt utifrån vår kunds specifika behov. Vi riktar in oss på uppdrag där vi tar ett helhetsansvar över projektets framgång och kan bemanna med ett helt team av våra egna anställda. Vi söker nära och långa samarbeten med kund där vi bygger långsiktigt hållbara lösningar.

Det som driver Decerno är att göra skillnad. För oss är det viktigt att vi kan bidra till en bättre värld och ett bättre samhälle. Därför har vi en stark etisk policy som guidar oss i våra val av projekt. Vi väljer aktivt bort projekt inom vapenindustrin och med koppling till alkohol, tobak eller spel om pengar. Dessutom siktar vi på att kunna koppla fler av våra projekt till FN:s globala hållbarhetsmål.

Rollen

Som konsult hos oss får du möjlighet att jobba inom varierande projekt och tekniker. Oavsett vilket projekt du är i för tillfället och varifrån projektet utgår, jobbar du alltid tillsammans med ett team som består av Decernos egna anställda. Du är alltså alltid omgiven av kompetenta och öppna kollegor som gärna delar med sig av olika erfarenheter till varandra genom projektets alla faser – både de svåra och de enklare bitarna – tillsammans skapar vi värde!

Är det här du?

För oss är det viktigt att du känner att du hamnat rätt. Därför lägger vi stor vikt vid vem du är och dina värderingar och inte enbart ditt cv. Med det sagt, ser vi gärna att du har ungefär 3-4 års tidigare erfarenhet av frontendutveckling, gärna i React/Vue.js och Typescript. Du behöver även vara flytande i svenska och engelska i såväl tal som skrift. Det viktigaste tycker vi är att du under arbetets gång förstår vad kunden är ute efter och tillsammans i teamet kan översätta det till användarvänliga lösningar för slutanvändaren. Sen är det meriterande (men inte absolut nödvändigt) om du tidigare har arbetat med Azure, azure devops, integrationer, .net web api eller CSS. En högskoleutbildning väger såklart också tungt, men tidigare erfarenhet som motsvarar utbildningen funkar också. Vi ser också gärna att du har erfarenhet av att arbeta i team och därför kommunicerar enkelt och ärligt med dina kollegor.

Varför du ska välja Decerno

I våra medarbetarundersökningar blir det gång på gång tydligt att det är de fantastiska kollegorna, de roliga och utmanande projekten och möjligheten att kunna bidra till samhällsnytta som gör att vi trivs så bra på Decerno.

Sedan finns det också några ytterligare aspekter som vi som arbetsgivare ser som självklarheter:

En flexibel arbetsplats med större frihet att planera vardagen för att få arbete och privatliv att gå ihop
Vi erbjuder extra föräldraförmåner för vi tycker att familjen är viktigast
Vi tycker att din kompetensutveckling är viktig! Därför anordnar vi interna utbildningar i vår egen Dec Academy och håller årliga konferenser
Vi vill att du ska må bra, trivas och ha roligt på arbetet och därför arrangerar vi regelbundet olika sociala aktiviteter, utmaningar och hälsotävlingar – såväl virtuellt som på plats (i vanliga fall)

Utöver detta erbjuder vi även ett brett förmånspaket som inkluderar bland annat friskvårdsbidrag och försäkringspaket. Vi berättar gärna mer om du vill veta vad mer vi på Decerno skulle kunna erbjuda dig.

Låter detta som ditt nästa steg i karriären?

Bra, då vill vi ha in din ansökan så snart som möjligt!

Vid frågor är du välkommen att kontakta HR-specialist Henny Forsberg på henny.forsberg@decerno.se

Vi välkomnar en mångfald av sökande med olika bakgrund och ser fram emot att få veta mer om dig och hur vi kan bli en del av ditt nästa steg i karriären.

På Decerno är vi ca 130 anställda fördelade på mellan vårt virtuella kontor och våra fysiska kontor i Stockholm, Uppsala, Göteborg, Malmö och Sevilla, Spanien. Vi är måna om vår familjära känsla av ett mindre bolag samtidigt som vi sedan 2010 har haft tryggheten av att vara en del av Addnode Group.",https://se.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appsharedroid&jk=d978a6316e939883

Vår digitala omställning ställer höga krav på att rätt data alltid finns tillgänglig i alla försäljningskanaler och beslutsstöd, för att möjliggöra ett datadrivet arbetssätt och ökad automation. 
  Vi har redan börjat vår resa där vi vill nyttja ett ”best-of-breed mindset” och använder oss av den senaste och bästa tekniken. Vårt fokus är att nyttja tekniker så som molntjänster (GCP), mikrotjänster, kubernetes, API-integrationer, headless och mobilapplikationsutveckling för att nämna några få. För att möjliggöra denna resa behöver vi en stark arkitekt som kan ta fram och leverera på de övergripande affärsmålen som finns framtagna.
  
   Rollen innebär Som arkitekt kommer du ta en aktiv roll i att utveckla vår strategi och målbild för den tekniska plattformen. Du kommer ha huvudansvaret för att designa, utveckla och underhålla vår arkitektur. På Bokusgruppen är kunden i fokus så din roll och de tekniska lösningar du skapar är självklart mycket affärs- och verksamhetsnära.
   Du kommer arbeta övergripande med att identifiera teknikstrategier, målarkitekturer och roadmaps för att möta och forma affärsstrategin. Detta arbete kan vara på både plattforms-, applikations- och affärsnivå men ligger ofta mitt emellan och knyter ihop kund, affär och IT.

IT-projektledare,QueensLab,411 19 GöteborgDistans,"Kan du vara snäll och hålla den här taktpinnen?
QueensLab är ett relativt ungt bolag med en stark tillväxt och vi har framför allt arbetat med välpolerade kompetenser inom programmering & design, allt eftersom att vi har växt så har vi fått större och större förtroende ifrån både existerande och nya kunder där vi nu får leverera riktigt häftiga, stora och tunga projekt.
Det tycker vi såklart är jättekul, och vi inser också att vi behöver mer projektledning då att den biten blir allt viktigare för oss. Därför har QueensLab satsat hårt och fortsätter satsa hårt på att bli ännu bättre på att leda våra projekt framåt.
Där kommer du in!
Vad gör man som projektledare på QueensLab och vad får man leda för typ av projekt?
Våra projekt ser oftast ut som så att de innehåller lite av design, lite UX och ofta lite mer programmering. Det rör sig om enklare webblösningar till mer komplexa tekniska system. Ibland involverar det IoT, ibland är det rena visualiseringsverktyg.
Som projektledare på QueensLab trivs du nog bäst om du gillar omväxling och kan leda både korta (1-3 veckor) och långa projekt (4-18 månader). Du tycker nog också att det är trevligt med kundkontakt, teammöten och att stötta dina kollegor.
Dina arbetsuppgifter innebär framför allt att hålla järnkoll på deadlines, kundavstämningar, stötta i teamleveranser, hålla & facilitera möten och workshops, göra viss dokumentation och att ha roligt med oss.
Är du vår nya kollega?
För att kunna bli vår nya kollega och projektledare behöver du ha arbetat minst tre år med att driva utvecklingsprojekt inom IT, gärna i ett mindre konsultbolag. Du förstår och kan skaffa dig en övergripande bild gällande C, Python och/eller React, men du behöver inte nödvändigtvis kunna koda själv. Du förstår tekniska begrepp samt är införstådd med de olika problemformuleringar som kan dyka upp i respektive projekt.
Du behöver inte vara ""Certified Scrum Master"" men det skadar naturligtvis inte heller och vi tror att du kommer trivas bäst om oss om du förstår och tycker om agila arbetsmetoder och har ett lösningsorienterat mindset.
Även om vi drar oss för att använda det uttjatade begreppet ”spindeln i nätet” så är det ett bra sätt att beskriva denna tjänst. Du kommer att ha ett tätt samarbete med kollegor i olika roller samt med våra kunder, som alla har sina unika behov. Med andra ord kommer det hända mycket på samma gång, vilket kräver att du är en strukturerad person som gillar att ta rollen som den just noggranna och strukturerade. Samtidigt är vi ett ganska litet konsultbolag där det kan svänga fort och du är därför redo att prioritera om och tänka kreativt. Du är vår unika IT-projektledare och därför är det också viktigt att du känner dig bekväm i rollen och kan driva ditt eget arbete framåt.
Livet på slottet
Du kommer in i ett snabbt växande företag som satsar mycket och strävar efter att ligga i framkant inom både teknik och design. På QueensLab får du en prestigelös och stöttande arbetsmiljö med fantastiska kollegor. Vi har också många roliga nyutvecklingsprojekt med utrymme för kreativitet och goda intraprenöriella utvecklingsmöjligheter.
Vi erbjuder dessutom:

Kompetensutveckling 4h i veckan
Generöst friskvårdsbidrag (maxbeloppet såklart)
Flexibla arbetstider
Jobbdator & valfri telefon
Kostnadsfria terminalglasögon och synundersökning
Valfria hörlurar
Kontor vid Domkyrkan
Utrustning för att jobba hemifrån
Pensionssparande
Sjukförsäkring
Trygghet och öppenhet mellan kollegor
Låter detta som något för dig eller någon du känner? Perfekt! Sök direkt eller tipsa någon som du tror är den rätte.

   Skulle du vara intresserad av hårdvara och servrar kan även reparation, montering och installation av servrar ingå i din roll då Nordic Peak har en egen serverhall.
   Dina nya kollegor

De flesta av oss är placerade på huvudkontoret i Sundsvall medan två av oss jobbar på distans från Gotland respektive Ö-vik. Gänget präglas av god sammanhållning och vi hittar gärna på gemensamma aktiviteter ihop. Vi har ett kreativt och öppet klimat med en stark feedbackkultur, där alla strävar efter att utvecklas. Martin Kero, systemutvecklare på bolaget beskriver sin första tid:
   ”Jag kände mig välkommen från första stund jag klev in på kontoret. Nordic Peak är ett familjärt företag där jag dagligen får arbeta med det jag älskar – programmering! Jag har tidigare arbetat som systemtekniker/utvecklare men längtade hem till Norrland och slipper nu de inställda pendeltågen i Stockholm. I min roll hos Nordic Peak har jag stort inflytande och frihet under ansvar vilket passar mig som trivs med att arbeta självständigt samtidigt som jag uppskattar att när som helst kunna bolla tankar och idéer med kollegorna.”
   Varför Nordic Peak?
   Även om programmering är vår passion tycker vi att en väl fungerande balans mellan fritid och arbete är A och O därför erbjuds flexibla arbetstider så att du som medarbetare får vardagen att gå ihop friktionsfritt. Några andra bra saker som gör det trevligt att jobba hos oss:
  
    På Nordic Peak spelar din åsikt roll. Vi tror att en öppen kommunikation bidrar till ett bättre arbetsklimat därför erbjuds du stort inflytande inom ditt område på bolaget.
    Utvecklare behöver rätt arbetsverktyg därför får möjlighet att själv välja din egen IT-utrustning.
    Som en del av Visma-koncernen har vi också stora muskler i ryggen men har samtidigt en familjär känsla med snabba beslutsvägar där vi får driva bolaget framåt enligt vår egen vision.
  
   Vem söker vi?
   Dig som har ett brinnande intresse för programmering och har erfarenhet av webb- och javaprogrammering som du införskaffat dig genom studier eller arbetslivserfarenhet. Du har goda kunskaper inom Java och är även van vid front-end utveckling med tekniker så som HTML, CSS och Javascript. Som person är du lösningsorienterad, kommunikativ och trivs bäst med frihet under ansvar.
   Ansökan
   Låter det intressant med rollen som utvecklare hos oss? Skicka då CV och gärna några rader där du berättar varför du ser dig själv hos oss på Nordic Peak! Vi arbetar med löpande urval. Har du frågor om tjänsten kontakta då VD Mattias på mattias.hallin@nordicpeak.com eller Talent Acquisition Ender Kökat på ender.kokat@visma.com. Välkommen med din ansökan!
   Om Nordic Peak
   Med ett brinnande intresse för tjänste- och produktutveckling, och mot en bakgrund som resurskonsulter i ett internationellt IT-företag började tankar utbytas om andra sätt att arbeta.
   En gemensam idé växte fram, om ett klimat där IT-lösningar kunde skapas med korta ledtider och med kvalitet och medarbetarnas kreativitet i första rum. Det ska vara nära från idé till genomförande och finnas förmåga att ta sig an helheten, från ""ax till limpa"". Snart stod det klart att steget till att bli entreprenörer var det som krävdes för att skapa rätt förutsättningar, och bygget av det som idag är Nordic Peak började. Än idag lever vi i den visionen där vi levererar helhetslösningar till framförallt offentlig sektor däribland vår e-tjänsteplattform Open ePlatform som används av över 140 kommuner från Kiruna i norr till Malmö i söder.

   Inclusion at ManyPets 
    We believe diversity, belonging and inclusion are more than just words or things we should be 'seen' to be doing. Having diversity at the core of our business makes us stronger - and the responsibility for creating an inclusive workplace rests with all of us. We believe Black Lives Matter and we want you to join a company that makes unbiased choices and is committed to being anti-racist. If you'd like to read more about this, please download our Approach to Inclusion pack. 
    We promise to give you the same opportunities as everyone else and we won't discriminate against you at any point in the process. This includes how we source talent, our interview process, our conditions of employment (including pay) and feedback. 
    Hybrid-Working 
    Everything changed overnight when the pandemic happened. Suddenly everything was different: whether we were in a home office, spare room, or makeshift desk: we were working on our own and dealing with Zoom calls, bad Wi-Fi, and a very different working day. We now work from home and our company office, so we've created our Making Work, Work guide, which explains it all. 
    We offer a fantastic range of company benefits to suit everyone in a remote-first world, with a focus on supporting our physical and mental wellbeing. Coupled with a generous holiday allowance and regular care packs, we're always looking for new ways to look out for our people. 
    Our Values 
    Our company values drive everything we do - and they are: 
    Show You Care | Do The Right Thing | Think Big | Work Together | Be Tenacious 
    Connect With Us! 
    LinkedIn | Instagram: UK USA Sweden| Facebook: UK USA Sweden | Twitter: UK USA | TikTok | Glassdoor | Indeed | FeeFo | Trustpilot | Crunchbase 
    Reasonable Adjustments and Support 
    If you need any help, support or advice at any point during the hiring process please email our Inclusion Council in complete confidence. Our Inclusion Council is a cross-functional group of people from our global business - and they are not the hiring managers for this role. We're here to make sure everyone has a fair and equitable experience when they're considering joining us. If you want to talk or ask any questions, we are here to listen (and we'll do what we can to flex our approach to a process that suits you.)

   The mission of your role
   As a full stack engineer at Karma, you’ll work in a modest team that is making a big difference, building innovative applications that solve difficult, meaningful challenges. You’ll be a vital part of a cross-functional team made up of engineers, a product designer, and a product owner, working across our stack from database to UI, with web and mobile technologies.

We’re flexible in what systems and parts of the product we work on, collaborate across teams, and we’re involved in features from inception to implementation, including polish and maintenance. We value good code and novel solutions, but know that they’re means to an end: done is better than perfect. We choose technologies ourselves and view them agnostically as tools that have pros and cons. At the moment we get things done with TypeScript (Node, React, React Native), GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Terraform, Google Cloud Platform.
   The bottom line
   If you’ve worked at a startup, you know. If you haven’t, here’s the rundown: there’s no room for egos, politics, or bull-sht. What we build today could be thrown out of the window tomorrow, but we build it with 100% commitment nonetheless. You’ll laugh more than you’ll cry, and look back at the work you do now in 10 years and think “how did we get that done?” And you’ll love every minute of it.

   Vi letar efter ytterligare utvecklare till vårt team för att hjälpa oss ta våra system och produkter till nästa nivå. Du kommer bli en tidig medlem i ett snabbt växande företag som arbetar i ett distribuerat team och vi välkomnar ansökningar från hela Sverige.
   Stabelo i ett nötskal
   Stabelo är Sveriges första och största bolåneutmanare som inte är en bank. Vi är också Sveriges första bolånefond och trots vår relativt korta existens så har Stabelo sedan start lånat ut dryga 23 miljarder kronor via både tredjepartsdistributörer såsom Avanza & Nordnet men även under eget varumärke. Genom att kombinera smarta och långsiktiga finansieringslösningar med en effektiv och digital bolåneprocess så kan vi erbjuda våra kunder schyssta bolån. Vi växer med 100% per år och arbetar för fullt med nya spännande produktlanseringar.
   Varför är den här rollen så viktig för oss
   På fem år har vi byggt en bolåneprodukt i världsklass men vi vet att resan bara har börjat. För att fortsatt befästa vår position som den största bolåneutmanaren så måste vi fortsätta att utmana befintliga tillvägagångssätt, och det kräver ännu större fokus på smarta tekniska lösningar.
   Vad du kan förvänta dig
   Det här är en chans att jobba nära både koden och teamet i vårt gemensamma arbete med att ta våra produkter till nästa nivå. Du kommer att utvecklas till en nyckelperson i arbetet med att överbrygga och implementera nya samt pågående initiativ på en konkret teknisk nivå med stort inflytande över att finna innovativa lösningar.
   Vi vill att du:
   
   Har kunskaper inom exempelvis JavaScript, Typescript eller React 
   Har stort intresse av att producera grym kod i en modern microservice-arkitektur 
   Har ett stort intresse att utvecklas till en fullstack utvecklare 
   Har viljan att applicera ML och AI i våra lösningar för automatisering 
   Har relevant utbildning som exempelvis civilingenjör inom fysik, matte, data, IT 
  
  Vi tror att du:
   
   Drivs av att vara självständig och tar eget ansvar 
   Är en resultatorienterad person 
   Har viljan att generera nya idéer på hur Stabelo kan utvecklas 
   Är engagerad och nyfiken i ditt sätt att arbeta 
   Trivs i att vara en del av ett familjärt, socialt team med stark gemenskap och kultur 
  
  Varför ska du välja Stabelo
   Du är välkommen att söka till vårt team på ungefär 40 personer som huserar vid Humlegården i centrala Stockholm. Vi är en blandad kompott personer som alla värderar ett avslappnat klimat på jobbet där allas röster är välkomna. Vi jobbar i agila processer som genomsyrar hela verksamheten och inte bara IT.

   Experience and/or interest in blockchain development

   What are we offering you? You will be a part of a small team of ten people with different excellent competences on a high academic level. You will also be a part of the beginning of a large adventure where the investors and the funding is safe and set. As part of the early team, you will be offered both stock option and token options in addition to your generous salary. This role is very important for us since we still have an open mind regarding what programming languages and tools to use.

Filen kan laddas ner heller hämtas från länken nedan och är en csv-fil. Vi har anonymiserat kundnamn och byggnader med namn på fåglar.
Du behöver inte använda all information utan kan välja visa upp en del av den. Syftet är att ha din kod som underlag för urval och diskussion vid en senare intervju. Det viktiga är att höra dig resonera om dina val och hur du tog dig an uppgiften.
Vi vill att du använder ramverket React eller Preact, men annars får du göra precis som du vill. Du kanske vill använda externa bibliotek eller skriva i TypeScript istället för JavaScript?

Nyfiken Systemutvecklare till BnearIT,Just Arrived AB,114 35 StockholmDistans,"Nyfiken systemutvecklare sökes!

BnearIT är ledande inom systemutveckling med systemintegration och tjänstebaserade lösningar. Vår erfarenhet inom området sträcker sig 20 år tillbaka i tiden och vår samlade kompetens är omfattande. Uppdragen spänner över allt från stora systemutvecklingsprojekt inom industrin till integrationsprojekt och utvecklingsprojekt för mjukvaruproduktföretag och ren kompetensförstärkning för kunder inom privat och offentlig sektor.

Vi är ett härligt gäng arbetskollegor med en tillåtande och öppen atmosfär och arbetsmiljö. Beroende på din erfarenhetsnivå kommer du att antingen direkt gå in i kunduppdrag eller så får du under en period arbeta med interna projekt för att på så vis skolas in i vårt sätt att arbeta med systemutveckling.
BnearIT har kollektivavtal och sjukförsäkring och det gör oss till en trygg arbetsplats där formerna för anställningen är fastställda i avtalet med exempelvis arbetstider, pensionsavsättningar och försäkringar.

Att arbeta som konsult på BnearIT innebär i stora drag att arbeta konsultativt inom området systemutveckling med kunder och uppdrag som kan variera från tid till annan. I konsultrollen ingår att ansvara för sina egna arbetsuppgifter att de utförs med hög kvalitet och inom givna ramar. Det innebär bland annat att nyttja vedertagna arbetssätt för att uppnå detta. Det gäller både för arbete med kunduppdrag och för interna processer och rutiner.

Beroende på erfarenhetsnivå så finns också ett ansvar att agera förebild för medarbetare med mindre erfarenhet i såväl uppdragen och hur man arbetar med kunden som interna processer och rutiner. Erfarenhetsnivån är också en betydande faktor när det gäller förväntad leverans och självständigt arbete. Ju mer erfarenhet desto större förväntningar på leveransförmågan (kvalitet och kvantitet) således.
Ibland innebär tjänsten att göra tjänsteresor för att arbeta i projekt hos våra kunder både inom och utanför landet.
Konsultrollen innebär vidare att både kunna be om hjälp och ge hjälp till kollegor som behöver det.

Arbetsuppgifter
Som systemutvecklare på BnearIT arbetar du dagligen med spännande uppdrag och olika tekniker. Vi har fantastiska kunder och uppdrag där du får jobba med problemlösning och programmering i en mängd olika miljöer.
Vi har under åren utvecklat några egna mjukvaruprodukter som vi är riktigt stolta över. Bland annat har vi tagit fram ett valideringsverktyg för att verifiera tjänstegränssnitt på ett automatiserat sätt. Vi har också utvecklat en produkt för att underlätta hanteringen och tömning av återvinningskärl som heter Smart Recycling. Där har vi utvecklat en maskinlärningsalgoritm som med realtidsdata lär sig när det är dags att tömma återvinningskärlet. Vi har utvecklat båda lösningarna med hjälp av en mängd olika tekniker och verktyg med Java i botten. Vi har också Agila team som jobbar på såväl java som .net-plattformen – såväl större industrikunder som mindre mjukvaruprodukter.

Tekniker
Vi arbetar främst med plattformarna Java och .NET samt Javascript, HTML/CSS, Vue, React och Angular i front-end. Programmeringsspråken är framför allt Java och C men det förekommer även andra språk som C/C++.

Metoder och verktyg
I de flesta uppdrag arbetar vi med Agil utvecklingsmetodik med Scrum eller Kanban eller varianter på dem.
När det gäller verktyg för ärendehantering och versionshantering använder vi bland annat JIRA, GIT och Docker.
Anställningen kommer formellt ligga hos Just Arrived AB men allt operativt arbete sker hos BnearIT.

As a Platform Lead you will act as a leader and one of the main contributors of the long term vision of our technology platform. This means developing strategies, policies and efficient processes for the platform in collaboration with the rest of the organisation. You will get to promote solutions of good quality, sustainable methodologies and good habits while also identifying and addressing problems and challenges in the platform and encouraging continuous improvement.
As part of your role, you would also join one of our cross-functional product teams dedicated to solving a problem and delivering outcomes within one of our product areas.

Have been mentoring and supporting less experienced colleagues and engineering teams, particularly in reducing technical debt and complexity in applications.
Love teamwork.
Are passionate about building great products that people love, and you always make technology choices with this end-goal in mind.
Are principled but also pragmatic: You value best-practices but realize that all rules have exceptions.
Experience working closely with business and product stakeholders, and thus a strong understanding of business and user requirements.
Speak English with professional working proficiency (Swedish is not a requirement).
It would also be music to our ears if you have:
Experience of one or more of the following: Python, Django, React & Redux, ElasticSearch, Docker, Kubernetes, GCP ecosystem, Kotlin.

Product Owner / Business Analyst for Subscriptions Capabilities (m/f/d)
Work from Berlin, Münster, Verl, Amsterdam, Oslo, Stockholm, Tallinn
So what are we looking for?
As the subscription economy is booming, so are the different use cases and needs. Let’s illustrate that with two examples. Some subscriptions, like car subscriptions, deal in high risks and open up room for different add-ons or pricing options, recurring or usage-based. Not to forget ad hoc costs like parking fines. In other cases, complexity comes from a B2B set-up with intricate billing based on complex tiered rate plans.
To be effective in today's marketplace, you require a high level of flexibility to match your consumers’ expectations. At the same time you need the capability to reliably deal with complex set-ups and growing markets. We want to provide a backbone for our clients that provides this combination of flexibility and reliability. It allows them to focus on their products and services and leave the admin to us.
As the Product Owner, you’ll work closely with all the subscription stakeholders to align the diverse needs towards a satisfying subscription experience for our clients and their customers. You'll translate the various needs into clear business stories and user stories, and guide the involved product teams in developing a seamless E2E solution.
In this volatile and uncertain market, you are geared towards an agile approach. This means iteratively developing new capabilities and then taking the time to listen to the clients and use their feedback to adapt and improve I the next iteration. Comfortably working with tech teams and translating back and forth between tech and business will be as much part of your day as E2E business process design.
To you pre-sales talks are not just about explaining about the benefits your product can offer.
They are very much an opportunity to keep learning about market requirements. They also present a chance to understand the individual needs of the potential client so that you can continually validate that your product really is offering answers to those needs.
What will you need?
3+ years experience in a role bridging the gap between business and IT, preferably as Agile Product Owner.
Outstanding ability to consider the big picture, think E2E and ensure optimization does not have negative impacts in the process somewhere down the line.
Ideally, experience as business process manager with BPMN skills.
Understanding of the e-commerce landscape and how merchants, platforms and solution providers interact.
Ideally 1+ year of experience in the subscription economy — minimum a sound basic understanding of the various types of subscriptions.
Excellent degree of communication skills, being able to effectively communicate both the strategic vision and specific details to various stakeholders — from senior leadership to individual product team members.
Responsible, communicative, assertive and open to intercultural and cross-functional issues.
Desire to constantly gain new insights on client and customer needs paired with the ability to react quickly to feedback, problems and even flops in order to deliver the best possible product to our clients and customers.
Excellent degree of analytical skills, ability to interpret data and trends, diagnose problems, and recommend effective action plans to resolve issues.
Ability to write clear and concise requirements focussing on needs, encouraging the team and leaving room to develop processes and features. At the same time, making use of a high IT affinity to understand tech challenges and ways of working.
Creativity and curiosity. #Listen and #CreateTheNext
We offer you:
Impressive flexibility: To make sure your private life is not overlooked, we support you with flexible working time models, 30 days of leave per year and family support.

Får man ha med husdjur till jobbet?

About this role
You will work as a Front-end developer within one of our client's teams where they are migrating into their new technology stack, using React. This work is done together with or in parallel with adding new business functionality.
As a senior developer, we expect you to be very active in refinement together with the team and PO with a focus on slicing stories based on how we can deliver value continuously. In addition to this, we have a goal to cross teams to work towards continuous delivery and we expect you to be able to take lead on those items and involve members from other teams in the process.
The teams have a possibility to work from our client's office Tuesdays and Wednesdays and it would be greatly appreciated if the consultant is able to work other days from the office as well. But of course, it all depends on FHM's future recommendations.
The team is responsible for building great customer experience within the B2C segment and these will be some of the team-member responsibilities:

Develop and implement new user-facing features
Drive transformation towards our new technologies, React and Contentful
Realizing CI/CD and azure DevOps pipelines
Close collaboration on design and UX (with the team) before implementation
Work hypothesis-driven and ensure that our customer’s experience is constantly challenged and improved.

To be successful in this role we believe that you like Parprogrammering (pair programming) and see it as an opportunity to share and learn new things. It is desired that you also like working in an agile team and understand what it really means.

     Background and role 
      SEI is developing a comprehensive database of agricultural crop production for all countries, providing the production, yield and area of the most important crops. This database focuses on providing this information at the finest subnational scale possible (provincial or municipal). To date, the lack of this information for most countries is a major gap hampering policymaking and research in fields as diverse as food security, international aid, climate and hydrological modeling, econometrics, geopolitical studies, supply chain analysis and the assessment of the drivers of land use change and deforestation. 
      The GSAP intern will support a team of four SEI researchers in: 
      
      acquiring and preparing agricultural data from several countries 
      geolocating the regions of production to match those of the GADM initiative 
      uploading the data to a simple database. 
      
     The selected intern will also have the opportunity to work on the creation of a simple front-end to serve the data (a global map) and scoping analyses of the final dataset leading, eventually to participation in scientific publications. 
      Essential skills 
     
      Keen interest in supporting open data efforts to help other researchers and practitioners in variety of fields 
      Interest and tenacity to handle multiple files (formatting, digitizing, scraping and editing) as well as performing quality assessment following predetermined rules 
      Basic knowledge of data handling and editing using Excel, EmEditor, R or similar 
      Curiosity and perseverance for understanding agricultural data of various countries, including interpreting data and translate the crop names to English, conducting internet searches to better understand the context and/or engaging with country experts by email or phone 
      High attention to detail and the ability to work independently and as part of a team. 
     
     Desirable skills 
     
      Basic understanding of one or more key global languages (Spanish, French, Arabic and/or Portuguese) 
      Previous experience with formatting and digitizing data 
      Basic GIS command using QGIS, ArcMap and/or Google Maps Platform.

Senior Backend Utvecklare webb,weITglobal,111 52 Stockholm,"Uppdragsspecifikation
Sektion Externa tjänster
Varje dag reser närmare en miljon människor med buss, tåg, båt eller färdtjänst i Region Stockholms kollektivtrafik. Under en dag har busslinje 4 lika många resenärer som SJ, och Hötorgets station lika många som hela Göteborgs central. Det är vi på inom Region Stockholm som ser till att hela det här komplexa systemet fungerar.
Verksamhet kräver mer och fler komplexa IT-lösningar som är en förutsättning för kollektivtrafiken med system och IT-utrustning för exempelvis trafikinformation, försäljning, trygghet, radio och trafikledning.
Sedan 2018 har vi stärkt upp vår förmåga inom digitalisering och egen utveckling och inom sektion Externa tjänster ansvarar vi för alla digitala tjänster mot resenärer, trafikutövare och samarbetspartners. Vi initierar och driver nya initiativ samt vidareutvecklar våra tjänster i enlighet med de digitala utvecklingsplanerna för att säkerställa att vi når övergripande digitaliseringsmål och de långsiktiga målen för Region Stockholms kollektivtrafik. Tillsammans med övriga inom IT ansvarar vi också för att implementera nya arbetssätt och processer för vår agila transformation inom områden som trafikinformation, nytt biljettsystem, våra digitala kanaler, Big Data och digitala stödsystem till moderna fordon.
Som anställd eller konsult förväntas man att efterleva värderingar vilket är:
Öppenhet: Ett enkelt hej kan leda till så mycket. Genom att bjuda in och dela med oss skapar vi en offentlig verksamhet med ett öppet klimat. Vi jobbar för hela regionens invånare. Alla räknas.
Kompetens: Hos oss vågar vi välja en riktning, men vi har också modet att tänka om. Vi tar tillvara på varandras kunskap och vill hela tiden lära mer. Här finns möjligheter att växa och utvecklas.
Pålitlighet: Tillsammans levererar vi kollektivtrafik och utvecklar den för framtiden. Vi är tydliga med både förväntningar och utmaningar. Om något inte fungerar förklarar vi varför och tar ansvar.
Samverkan: Hos oss är alla en del av helheten, det ger energi. Vi inkluderar alla som behövs för att vi ska kunna nå de gemensamma målen.
IT-avdelningen (IT) ansvarar för design, utveckling och förvaltning av digitala tjänster för att bidra till en attraktiv och hållbar kollektivtrafik.
Beskrivning av uppdraget
I uppdraget ingår att utveckla webbaserade lösningar främst riktade mot SLs nya biljettsystem. Arbetet med att bygga det nya biljettsystemet har pågått under några år och närmar en kritisk fas under det närmaste året då många de sista delarna byts ut. Projektet vann 2021 priset Årets digitala projekt vid CIO awards. Som medlem i webbteamet kommer du arbeta som en del i detta projekt.
Webbutveckling hos bedrivs idag av tre agila team. Tillsammans ansvarar vi för samtliga webbsajter, som bl a sl.se, waxholmsbolaget,se och fardtjanst. regionstockholm.se. Teknikstacken är modern och förnyas kontinuerligt vid behov, den är huvudsakligen byggd kring en mikroarkitektur bade i frontend och backend. Huvudsakligen arbetar vi med React i frontend och .Net i backend, strävan är att arbeta i en cloudbaserad miljö i Azure så långt som möjligt. Inom frontend används ett eget komponentsystem underbyggt av ett designsystem baserat i Figma. Vi fokuserar vår utveckling på att skapa fristående, test och releasbara komponenter med hög kvalitet och prestanda och har en strävan att automatisera så stor del av arbetet som möjligt. Utvecklingsarbetet bedrivs av sammansvetsade team som strävar mot snabba releaser och en miljö där varje teammedlem känner sig delaktig i den gemensamma produktutvecklingen.
Din roll blir att stärka upp i det webbteam som arbetar med tjänster som e-handel, biljetthantering och kundprofil-sidor. De användare vi vänder oss mot är allt från resenärer i kollektivtrafiken som vill hantera sina biljetter till större företag som gör stora inköp för sina anställda. Utvecklingen är huvudsakligen feature-baserad då det mestadels sker nyutveckling i detta skede.
Uppdraget möjliggör för närvarande både arbete på distans och på plats på kontoret på Kungsholmen i Stockholm. På sikt kommer vi ses inne på kontoret oftare. Dagar och tider för detta styrs efter behov av i organisationen och i de agila team man arbetar.

  Do you want to build web solutions that enable state-of-the-art machine learning and make a positive difference in society? Then you might be our new Senior Frontend Developer!
   Pluto Technologies is a fast-growing startup assembling a killer team to empower infrastructure maintenance with AI monitoring. Today, we're live with our first product focused on the largest public infrastructure endeavor in human history - roads.
  
   Who are you?
   You have been working as a software engineer, have a solid understanding of the javascript engine, and have experience in shipping products. Your skillset is broad, you are a fast learner and you love the process of building products. You thrive in a high-performance environment, not satisfied with an ordinary job, not afraid to get your hands dirty, and up for a challenge.

   Pluto Technologies is an early-stage, machine learning startup using AI monitoring of infrastructure to support better and safer roads. We collaborate closely with our customers and empower everyone on the team to share inputs and ideas for improvements.

   Your contribution:
   We're continuously extending our product capabilities to make data more actionable for our clients via a web dashboard. As the core product is a data-heavy interactive map (run on Mapbox GL) it's also key that we ensure high performance in our web application. It's a bonus if you also have a good UX / design feel to also spot ways to continuously improve the product experience.
  
   As part of the team:
   Building a company is difficult and hence requires a lot of effort and hours together. Therefore, we're looking for colleagues - that not only are ambitious and intelligent - but also want to be part of a team where true friendships are formed. We appreciate radical ownership and people who dare to take responsibility. You will be part of a tight-knit team with an ambitious goal and a real spirit of innovation. With us, you will have an opportunity to truly impact the outcome of your work and the people it affects.
  
   Requirements:
  
    You have min 3+ years of experience as a Frontend developer or a similar role.
    Familiarity and fluency in modern build pipeline for JavaScript applications
    Experience with building stateful apps - ideally React & Typescript

    Mapbox WebGL

  Senior Frontend Engineer - Asset Discovery & Management 
  What we do at Detectify 
   The fear of cyber threats should never stand in the way of digital greatness. That is why we are changing the fundamentals of how cyber security works. We collaborate with ethical hackers to build a powerful platform that automates and scales crowdsourced vulnerability research. 
   For us, security is not just about protecting what you have but more so a tool to achieve what you want. At Detectify, your opinion and ideas matter. You belong to a dedicated, driven and forever curious team that recognises the power of knowledge sharing and challenging the status quo. 
   We value diversity of minds, different backgrounds, and perspectives. We are all here because we want to make a positive impact in the world. If you are collaborative and passionate about what you do, then you too could be a Detectifyer. 
   Attack Surface Discovery team 
   Detectify is looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer, who likes to work across the entire stack, to join our Attack Surface Discovery team. 
   The team is a cross competence team responsible for building the most complete and updated picture of customers' attack surface, enabling them to stay on top of their tech-stack and when to take action without having in-depth knowledge about security. 
   Internally we are known as Grandma Sharks Gang, a happy and friendly autonomous cross-functional team. Together we handle everything from discovery to delivery in a highly collaborative environment where we are fans of data and hypothesis driven development, mob and pair programming all to maximize learning from our users and each other. 
   The team lives in the Engineering function, where we strive to create an enabling, empowered culture where you have the ability to make use of all your skills and personality. A fun and engaging environment where we can have unfiltered and passionate discussions to learn and grow together. A highly diverse culture allowing all genders, preferences, personalities and backgrounds to thrive. 
   What you'll get to do 
   As a Senior Frontend Engineer in Grandma Sharks Gang, you will collaborate with designers, product managers, researchers, data analysts and your fellow engineers in a dynamic and empowered product-driven environment. 
   You will drive architecture together with your team within the domain and contribute to decisions across teams. You will use the latest technologies to solve real problems for our customers at a massive scale, and explore modern software development methods, such as continuous discovery, elephant carpaccio, event storming and impact mapping. 
   Furthermore, you will participate in cross team efforts to improve our architecture or development environment. Think it, build it, ship it, tweak it. 
   Who you are 
   You love to work in a highly collaborative environment and enjoy learning and growing together with your fellow team members. Pair programming or even mob programming is within your preferred toolbox. 
   You are comfortable contributing to the entire stack even if frontend development is your main focus and you have substantial experience from working with modern JavaScript/CSS/HTML coding, testing, debugging, and automation techniques. Especially good if you are familiar with technologies like TypeScript, React, Styled Components, GraphQL, AWS, but not a requirement as long as you are eager to learn. 
   You typically come from a background where you are used to working in a cross functional team building products and taking part in the entire product development lifecycle. 
   As a person you are genuinely interested in your field of expertise and staying up to date with current best practices and ways of working.
   
   So, what do you think? 
   We are proud to foster an inclusive workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and background will lead to a better environment for our employees and a better product. This is something we value deeply and we encourage everyone to be a part of changing the way the world thinks about security! Go hack yourself! 
   Remote Work 
   This position is for the Stockholm office. We offer remote working, with access to our office in central Stockholm. We think you should be able to work from anywhere but for tax reasons we need you to be located in Sweden, and we are more than happy to help you relocate. We'll help you with both your work permit and make sure you have a place to stay.

Senior Frontend-utvecklare,Caspeco,753 20 UppsalaDistans,"
  Om Caspeco
   Dagens Caspeco uppstod år 2006 – i mötet mellan en legendarisk krögare och en smart Uppsala-student. Per Söderqvist hade drivit ett antal populära krogar, men med blandad ekonomisk framgång. När han drev krog i Uppsala tog han in en sommarpraktikant för att hjälpa honom att få koll på utgifter, inkomster, marginaler och bemanning. Med hjälp av ett egenutvecklat excel-ark kunde Per Söderqvist över en natt få en helt ny överblick – och lönsamheten steg.
   Idag erbjuder Caspeco fyra kompletta system för krogar- och upplevelseindustrin. Vi kallar dem Bokning, Kassa, Personal och Analys. Bolaget består idag av cirka 100 medarbetare, 2500 kunder i en organisation där beslutsvägarna är korta, varje medarbetare gör skillnad, och nya idéer och initiativ premieras. Vi vill att våra medarbetare ska växa i takt med företaget och arrangerar regelbundet events som Uppsala.js och Uppsala Tech där vi delar med oss och lär oss av andra i branschen. Nu söker vi efter en Frontend-utvecklare i vår fortsatta tillväxtresa!
   Din roll som Senior Frontend-utvecklare

Caspecos erbjudande gör det möjligt för restauranger och andra aktörer att erbjuda sina gäster möjligheten att beställa online, även i samarbete med befintliga aktörer så som Foodora, UberEats etc.
   De system vi bygger och underhåller omfattar såväl webbaserade verktyg som native mobil-appar och fristående applikationer. Det viktiga för oss är att tillhandahålla verktyg som är såväl användarvänliga som intelligenta.
   Dina kvalifikationer
   
    Flerårig professionell erfarenhet av frontendutveckling, vi använder React på vissa produktområden och Angular i andra 
   Bra på JavaScript/TypeScript 
   Erfarenhet av enhetstester och E2E-testing (vi använder bland annat Jest, Testing Library, Cypress, MSW)

Senior Frontend/WebGL Engineer - Connected Factory,Northvolt,Stockholm,"The digitalization team at Northvolt is looking for candidates that get excited about the idea of making a factory smart using a cutting-edge technology stack.
What does it mean?

You will work on and take lead in developing frontend applications using react, three.js, typescript, etc., in order to develop cutting-edge user experiences for the people working and operating the factories.
Data and access to information should be an integrated part of everything we do at Northvolt. Ensuring the right people have access to the right information at the right time, in order to do their job as effective and efficiently as possible.

Do you have an example of what I would do?

Working together with a product owner and people from other functional teams, you could work on defining and implementing the user interfaces that provide insights and allows control of the autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) fleets across the Northvolt factories. You will make sure we can safely, effectively, and predictably manage multiple material movements per hour, managed by hundreds of AGVs. To get there, you might get to collaborate with someone that can help you in updating what information we send from our machines or with someone working on a separate system that keeps track of production schedules. When questions come up, you discuss them with the team. Working on this, you are more than likely to talk with people from various backgrounds and nationalities as we are currently people from more than 100 nations working at Northvolt.

What are you looking for in a candidate?

We are looking for someone that feels comfortable solving problems with code. And who gets excited about tackling challenges. Someone who is not afraid to roll up your sleeves and walk out in the factory to fully understand and set yourself up for successful problem-solving.

Why would I apply for this job?

You will be working with amazing people on problems that matter. Not, only for the bottom line of the company but also for the future of this planet.
What growth opportunities are there for me?

We win as a team - and fail as a team. Things go wrong, and we learn from them. Here you will never feel afraid of making mistakes. You will have the opportunity to take ownership of projects from the get-go and still feel that there is someone who has your back. When you don't know what to do, you can always reach out to your team.

Apply with CV and cover letter or your complete LinkedIn profile. We look forward to hearing from you!

Våra förväntningar på dig

Vi är en resultatinriktad byrå med prestigelösa medarbetare som gillar att prestera tillsammans som team, så är du en lagspelare kommer du trivas riktigt bra.

Du är trygg i din roll som frontendutvecklare, är självgående, ansvarstagande och initiativrik. Trots din senioritet är du fortfarande nyfiken och hungrig på ny teknik och innovativa lösningar på komplexa problem. Våra kunder är våra uppdragsgivare och det är toppen om du dessutom är en öppen och social person. Det är ok att vara blyg också, men det är ett krav att du är lyhörd och förstår kundens behov.

Ditt nya arbete

Du kommer ha ett stort inflytande över teknikval, arkitektur, plattformar, verktyg och kod. Kort och gott - frihet under ansvar! Man lär sig oftast bäst i kundprojekt så vi försöker alltid att testa nya saker, stora som små. På samma sätt som frontend-världen tidigare tog klivet ifrån jQuery till Angular, React och Vue är vi nu på väg mot serverrenderade js-ramverk, headless CMS och allmänt mer appliknande upplevelser. Det är i denna övergång vi på Limetta befinner oss i och det är där vi hoppas att du vill vara med och utvecklas!

Som många gillar vi att arbeta agilt och det är en fördel om du hört talas om scrum, estimering och backloggar.

Ditt arbete kommer bli väldigt varierande eftersom vi arbetar med ett brett spektrum av kunder. Alltifrån bank till apotek, djurfoder och fastighetsförvaltning. Vill du veta mer om vad vi faktiskt har gjort tillsammans med våra kunder kan du läsa mer om våra kunduppdrag

Senior Frontendutvecklare inom E-handel,Vendre,113 59 Stockholm,"Vi vill bli bäst. På e-handel! Vi letar efter dig som tycker att e-handel är lika spännande som vi och som vill ta oss och vår utveckling framåt.
Kort om oss
Vendre bygger och utvecklar ett e-handelssystem för svenska bolag som säljer till Sverige och internationellt. Vi har funnits i 13 år och vår tillväxtresa har tagit ordentlig fart. Med en tillväxttakt på ca 40% per år de senaste två åren och nöjda kunder så blir det kul att gå till jobbet.
Vi har ett tydligt mål att bygga Sveriges bästa e-handelsplattform och i rollen som Senior Frontendutvecklare är du en viktig del av vårt Customer Relations team. I teamet är vi 5 personer som jobbar dedikerat med våra existerande kunder för att hjälpa dem i deras utveckling och tillväxt. Exempel på några av våra kunder är Ur & Penn, mStore, Geggamoja, Micki leksaker och många fler, både större och nystartade, alla med stora ambitioner.
Om jobbet och teamet
Vi ses varje morgon i Teams och kör en daglig standup. Alla våra uppgifter och kontakter finns tydligt strukturerade och dokumenterade. Teamet jobbar nära varandra och löser saker tillsammans men vi ansvarar själva för att genomföra och driva våra uppgifter.
Då vi jobbar med befintliga kunder handlar det oftast om löpande utveckling och arbetsuppgifterna varierar från enklare justeringar till avancerad logik och problemlösning på en mer komplex nivå. Arbetsuppgifterna innehåller även mentorskap, estimera/uppskatta och att ha kundkontakt med hög service i fokus.
All kod genomgår code reviews för att ständigt hålla hög kvalitet. Varannan vecka kör vi kodmöten där vi diskuterar utmaningar & strategier framåt.
Det här kan vara ditt drömjobb om du värderar...

Att lära ut, tycker det är kul att agera som mentor och vill vara en förebild.
Problemlösning på komplex nivå.
En arbetsmiljö som uppmuntrar till att ta initiativ och ägarskap.
En miljö där man förstår kraften av teamarbete.
En roll där du har möjlighet att växa och ta mycket ansvar.

Vi söker dig som...
…har arbetat flera år som Frontend eller som fullstack och ser dig själv som senior i ditt område.
Behärskar SCSS, HTML och Javascript och du har säkerligen jobbat i flera ramverk men ett extra plus om du jobbat i React, Vue.js, Jquery och eller Twig.
Har hanterat större applikationer/system, du är social, gillar att dela med dig av dina kunskaper och uppskattar kundkontakt men lika mycket som att dyka ner i kod några dagar i veckan. Allt du jobbar med har självklart ett GIT-repo där du håller ordning och reda med tydliga feature branches.
Rollen kommer att anpassas efter hur vi bäst passar ihop. Vi har behov av såväl ren Frontend som fullstack och vi tror att vi alla är som bäst motiverade när vi får göra det vi verkligen tycker om.
Du kommer att arbeta med ett kunnigt team så ditt viktigaste verktyg är att du har en vilja och motivation att lära dig nya saker och gillar att hitta enkla lösningar på komplexa utmaningar.
Låter det som jobbet för dig?

   Uppdragslängd: Ca. 12 månader 
   Uppdragsstart: Enligt ök. 
   Sista ansökningsdagen: ansök snarast 
   Omfattning: 100% 
   OBS! Det är väldigt viktigt att du uppfyller skall-kraven för att vi överhuvudtaget ska kunna offerera dig, annars förkastar beställaren vårt anbud omgående där både din tid resp. vår tid går till spillo. 
  
  Arbetsbeskrivning I uppdraget ingår att utveckla webbaserade lösningar främst riktade mot nya system. Arbetet med att bygga det nya systemet har pågått under några år och närmar en kritisk fas under det närmaste året då många de sista delarna byts ut. Som medlem i webbteamet kommer du arbeta som en del i detta projekt.
   Webbutvecklingen bedrivs idag av tre agila team. Teknikstacken är modern och förnyas kontinuerligt vid behov, den är huvudsakligen byggd kring en mikroarkitektur både i frontend och backend. Huvudsakligen arbetar kunden med React i frontend och .Net i backend, strävan är att arbeta i en cloudbaserad miljö i Azure så långt som möjligt.
   Inom frontend används ett eget komponentsystem underbyggt av ett designsystem baserat i Figma. Kunden fokuserar deras utveckling på att skapa fristående, test och releasbara komponenter med hög kvalitet och prestanda och har en strävan att automatisera så stor del av arbetet som möjligt.
   Utvecklingsarbetet bedrivs av sammansvetsade team som strävar mot snabba releaser och en miljö där varje teammedlem känner sig delaktig i den gemensamma produktutvecklingen.
   Din roll blir att stärka upp i det webbteam som arbetar med tjänster som e-handel och kundprofil-sidor. Utvecklingen är huvudsakligen feature-baserad då det mestadels sker nyutveckling i detta skede.
   Obligatoriska kompetenser och erfarenhet (skallkrav): 
  
   Minst 5 års arbetslivserfarenhet inom webbutveckling 
   Minst 3 års erfarenhet av utveckling i ReactJS

   Minst 2 års arbetslivserfarenhet av att utveckla mot WCAG

   Minst 2 års arbetslivserfarenhet av att ha jobbat nära UX med designsystem och verktyg så som Storybook 
   Minst 1 års arbetslivserfarenhet av att ha jobbat med Code Review 
   Minst 1 års arbetslivserfarenhet av utveckling inom e-handelslösningar 
   Minst 1 års arbetslivserfarenhet av att ha jobbat i tvärfunktionella teams 
   Minst 1 års arbetslivserfarenhet av att ha jobbat agilt i utvecklingsteam 
   Minst 1 års arbetslivserfarenhet av headless CMS

"Senior Full Stack Engineer (Node.js, React.js)",Utopia Music,114 59 StockholmDistans,"WELCOME TO UTOPIA
Music is incredible. It can excite hundreds, and unite thousands. But as an industry, it has been slow, complicated, and disparate. While the tech world has moved into the future, the music industry continues to be shaped by inefficient systems of the past. At Utopia we believe there is a better way. Which is why today we are setting out to transform the entire industry; creating new revenue streams, consolidating the data and decluttering the admin. Unlocking the industry’s full potential by unifying it all in one truly holistic space. Some might call that a Utopia.
Funnily enough, so do we. Welcome to Utopia. Where music lives.
WHAT UTOPIANS DO

Senior Integration Developer,Billogram,111 52 StockholmDistans,"
  Welcome! This is Billogram and we’re into digital invoicing. Why? Because traditional invoicing is lame. It’s basically anxiety on a paper, filled with apprehension (did I pay my invoices? Did our customer get their invoice?) and when done wrong it can waste so much time and energy. Time and energy that both sender and recipient could spend doing something else.
   It’s not the easiest thing to solve – we want both sender and recipient to have the best experience possible but since their interests don’t always align it’s up to us to come up with smart solutions to satisfy both parties. And to do that we need you to join our team of integration developers.
   As a Senior Integration Developer, you will work closely with the Customer Delivery Manager and take our customers (the invoice senders) through the onboarding process; getting the customer from sign to live as efficiently as possible. This is where we match their processes and current information architecture to our service to ensure the best and most seamless fit within the customer’s workflow.
   This means that you need to be able to understand and contextualize the customer’s workflow, comprehend how we can provide the most value through our product and integration. It means being creative, communicative, and empathic as well as being a good programmer. As a Senior Integration Developer, we’d like you to be familiar with the entire stack from database to frontend but you’re most comfortable with backend. You have +5 years of professional experience in software development, and hopefully, you might have come across some of the techniques that we are using in the past. A few examples of our tech stack includes:
  
   Python
   React.js
   DynamoDB
   MySQL 
   AWS
  
   We’d like you to contribute to our technical and product development process by taking our integration solution to new heights. We also believe that you thrive in an environment where you can use your technical knowledge to help your teammates to grow through discussions and mentorship. 
  Billogram is currently a team close to 150, but aiming for quite some growth during the rest of this year and onwards. That means you’ll be joining at a time of change and your perspective will help shape what that change results in. You’ll join a team of truly dedicated and helpful co-workers at a super cozy office as central as you get in Stockholm. There will be lots of challenges and lots of laughs. 
  Billogram is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified individuals will receive consideration for employment regardless of gender, transgender identity or expression, ethnicity, religion or other beliefs, disability, sexual orientation or age.

Senior Konsult inom Business Intelligence,Columbus,111 36 Stockholm,"
  Columbus och vårt affärsområde Data & Analytics står inför en mycket spännande tillväxtresa som vi hoppas att du vill vara en del av. Vi söker nu fler seniora BI-konsulter som kan ta lead i våra kundprojekt där många av våra projekt ligger i teknisk framkant. 
  Arbetsuppgifter
   Vi erbjuder en roll med stora möjligheter att växa med oss. Gillar du att ta initiativ och vara med och påverka? Bra! Då kommer du trivas som fisken i vattnet. 
  I rollen som senior BI-konsult kommer du förutom att arbeta med BI bekanta dig med en rad olika tekniker. Du kommer att vara delaktig i hela processen - från initial dialog med kunden och framtagning av kravspecifikationer och design, till implementering. 
  Här berättar Paul om sin roll som BI-konsult och varför han valt att jobba just hos oss: 
  ""På Columbus finns en stor kundflora – vilket ger en bred och intressant inblick i olika typer av projekt och kunder från olika branscher. Det som skiljer oss från andra bolag, utöver att vi också har en egen ERP-leverans, är att vi levererar projekt och inte resurskonsulter. 
  Det finns möjlighet att påverka och förändra både i projekten och i teamet. Jag får ett stort förtroende hos våra kunder och inom organisationen och får under ett projekts gång vara involverad i flera olika processer och roller. 
  Jag har en stor möjlighet att påverka vart teamet ska och det finns en möjlighet för mig att utvecklas inom de områden jag tycker är intressanta! För den som vill finns möjligheten att kontinuerligt utmanas och utvecklas. 
  Idag jobbar jag mer på en konceptuell nivå än i tidigare roller och det är inte ovanligt att delta i strategi och arkitekturmöten på ledningsgruppsnivå med kundverksamheten. 
  Jag samarbetar mycket med våra ERP-konsulter i andra affärsområden och är inte sällan en deltagare i ERP-implementeringar som en representant för BI och data management. Jag jobbar även en hel del med kollegor i andra länder – på Columbus har vi ett internationellt nätverk med över 100 BI-konsulter som man kan söka inspiration från eller plocka kompetenser till ett projekt.

Senior mjukvaruutvecklare som vill göra skillnad för vårt...,Lindinvent,224 78 Lund,"Vi söker en senior mjukvaruutvecklare som trivs med allt från inbyggda system till appar och webb. Störst fokus för denna tjänst är mot webb och .net för våra webbaserade användargränssnitt. Är du fascinerad av IoT och drömmer om att göra något åt klimatproblematiken med smarta lösningar?
Vem är vi?
Vi är ett entreprenörsdrivet och familjeägt företag. Från vårt huvudkontor i Lund utvecklar vi med hjälp av den senaste tekniken intelligenta, klimatsmarta lösningar för energieffektiva byggnader. Vårt produktsortiment sträcker sig från hårdvara och mjukvara för inneklimat, belysning, solskydd till användargränssnitt i form av webb och appar. Allt för att skapa energieffektiva innemiljöer i kommersiella fastigheter, skolor, sjukhus och labb. Vi har över 2000 referensobjekt vi är väldigt stolta över t.ex. huvudkontoren för SEB, Telia och Swedbank.
Dessutom har vi belönats med Stora innekmatpriset, Stora energipriset och Årets företagare i Lund.
Våra produkter
Vi utvecklar världsledande produkter inom behovsstyrt inneklimat och fastighetsautomation. Detta med olika sensor, kommunikation med CAN, Modbus TCP, TCP/IP, DALI samt trådlösa teknologier som Enocean och Bluetooth. Utveckling av firmware för ARM-processorer, backend-applikationer i .net för optimering, detta med marknadsledande webbgränssnitt för fastigheter som spetsas med API:er, appar och mycket mer.
Teamet
Lindinvent består av allt från produktion till service med totalt 95 personer på fem orter varav 13 personer på utvecklingsavdelningen. Du kommer att ingå i ett starkt team bestående av engagerade och uppfinningsrika utvecklare som drivs av att paralellt lösa avancerade problem inom många olika teknikområden. Hos oss har du stor frihet och utrymme att testa nya kreativa idéer som kan leda till smarta lösningar på kort tid.
I utvecklingsteamet gör man ofta efterforskningar på ny teknologi inom helt andra områden som sedan kan appliceras i de egna lösningarna i syftet att erbjuda kunderna så intelligenta och effektiva system som möjligt. Teamet arbetar mycket självständigt med nya produkter och lösningar dvs. från systemdesign och prototyp till implementation. Detta ger oss en utvecklingsmiljö som präglas av korta beslutsvägar och stor personlig frihet.
Profil

Det kan vara en fördel om du arbetat i mindre bolag där man inte alltid har 100% klara specifikationer och det kan råda lite ”produktivt kaos”. Vi tror att du är en pragmatisk generalist som med lätthet navigerar ibland de senaste nyheterna inom mjukvaruutveckling och känner dig bekväm med att sätta dig in i nya ramverk och de språk som krävs för uppgiften. Har du erfarenhet av att arbeta med säkerhet i dessa frågor så ser vi det som positivt.

Attraheras du dessutom av utmaningen att haka på ett fantastiskt team som är på randen att ta en svensk molnprodukt från idé till global etablering så är vi på Spintr jätteintresserade av att träffa dig!
Tjänsten
Utvecklingsteamet på Spintr söker nu en driven kollega som gillar ett omväxlande utvecklingsarbete och som bredvid utvecklingen gillar att ha löpande kontakt och arbeta mot kunder och partners.
Bredvid full stack system- och webbutveckling kommer du arbeta med att stötta kunder med att starta upp Spintr tekniskt hos kunden. Det handlar ofta om att koppla ihop vår tjänst med kundens infrastruktur och att säkerställa så leveranser och kopplingar mot Active Directory, ADFS och Single sign-on kommer på plats och fungerar.
Du ansvarar för att kunden får allt den behöver och för att göra de integrationer som kunden beställt. Du arbetar ofta mot kundens IT-avdelning eller deras IT-partner och stöttar med frågor och svar kring de integrationer som ska göras.
Ibland beställer kunderna även lite mer komplexa leveranser där vi måste göra djupare integrationer och mer anpassningar till kundens system. Ditt uppdrag blir då att delta i projektgrupp och får då en viktig leveransroll där du förväntas, utifrån en kravbild ta fram en lösning på kundens problemställning och implementera denna.
När du inte arbetar med leveranser och integrationer deltar du i produktutvecklingen och förbättrar vår tjänst genom implementering av nya funktioner, idéer, rättningar och fixar.
Spintrs teknikorganisation består en operationsavdelning som ansvarar för framdriften av tjänsten och en kreativ utvecklingsavdelning där du ingår. Du rapporterar till vår tekniska chef som ansvarar för båda avdelningarna.
Vem är du
Vi ser gärna att du minst har några års yrkeslivserfarenhet av att arbeta som utvecklare av små eller stora system. Produktutveckling är förstås särskilt meriterande.
Vi tror att du har erfarenhet av både utveckling på Microsofts teknologier och på Microsofts infrastrukturprodukter. Vi söker dig som gillar att bygga ihop och integrera system – som helt enkelt gillar att få saker att fungera tillsammans.
Du gillar webbutveckling och är bekant med relevanta utvecklingsspråk som AngularJS, React Native, C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS och på serversidan är du bekant med Microsofts teknologier och infrastruktur. Utveckling mot Office 365 är meriterande.
Vi tror att du att du har något intresse bredvid jobbet som du brinner för och som du gärna vill dela med dig av till dina kollegor. Spintr är olika typer av individer, vi gillar olika och vi älskar att lära oss av varandra.

Som anställd på Spintr får du möjlighet att gå på konferenser och relevanta utbildningar, och att ta certifieringar som du behöver för att kunna utvecklas inom utvecklarrollen.
Förmåner

Tibber is the first fully digital energy company in the world. We choose not to make money on our customer's consumption, we much rather help them lower it which is pretty ""out there"" being an energy company – it shouldn't. We’re the only energy company with the mission to reduce residential energy consumption in Europe by 20%. We’re constantly challenging the “dinosaurs” in the market by using new technology and fresh ideas.
Starting out with two passionate founders in 2016, we're now 160 people working at Tibber, and with that very number growing each week, we’re still just getting started. Our growth rate has been truly amazing and we are now helping over 200.000 customers to reduce their energy consumption in four different markets. With hundreds of thousands of controllable and smart devices connected to the Tibber platform (like electric vehicles and smart thermostats), we have one of the most unique and flexible consumption portfolios trading energy and flexibility on the market.

About The Job ‍
You will belong to our brilliant and skilled Web Core squad and will work closely with our web developers. You will take part in developing our current platform that utilises modern technologies such as React/Vue and Next.

While your main responsibilities would be the site you will also get to dabble with our fantastic Tibber store. It’s one of the biggest online stores within the smart home category in the Nordics, and we will trust you to make it even better.

Who you are
You're a curious and experienced developer with an exploratory mindset.
You have several years of experience within JavaScript, and preferably with React/Vue.
You're confident to work in a team, but you also feel comfortable taking initiatives on your own.
It is of great importance that you're a person that has an eye for details both visually and when it comes to coding.
As the entire Tibber team is spread across four countries we see it important that you have good communication and self organising skills.
You're not afraid to speak your mind, at Tibber we embrace new and fresh ideas!
With a great passion for web/front-end development, IoT, and doing something for a greater cause, you would love to take on the task of building something great together. And like the rest of your future colleagues, you will always put the customer first.

What we offer
A way to change the landscape and disrupting of one of the most important industries on the planet
A startup journey of a lifetime
A possibility to grow personally and professionally within a fast-growing environment
A place where you'll meet friends for life
A story to tell your grandkids

The Tibber Mindset
Being on a mission to fundamentally change an industry also means being prepared for the unexpected. Tibber is a startup in the true sense of the word, which means we are on a journey of constant change. We work passionately with sustainability and a circular approach, both with our own products and in the entire ecosystem that is affected by everything we do. The well-known fact that all people are different, and far from everyone is a morning person – are the very reasons why we choose to work with flexible work hours.
The majority of our investors are proudly represented by Tibber employees, Eight Roads Ventures, Balderton Capital, Silicon Valley-based Founders Fund, Petter Stordalen – and more.

Join the electric revolution, join our Tibber Tribe!

     As part of Neo4j product engineering, you will work together with a diverse team of talented colleagues from around the world. Our culture encourages engineers who want to become deep experts in a particular field – or to build broad expertise across several technologies. Our engineers regularly work with peers in field engineering and experience the full lifecycle of the systems they build.
   
   
   
     We build technology that helps cure cancers, addresses diabetes, and gets humans to Mars. We're proud to fight fraud, crush pandemics, and even help journalists uncover the truth. Neo4j’s engineering teams are located in Malmö, Sweden and London, UK.

     We also have a large user base in the enterprise world and prior experience with working within an enterprise environment would be a big plus.

You will have the opportunity to go into the depths of open source technologies such as Electron, Chromium, GraphQL, React, NestJS and participate in the open source community.

Software Engineer - Predictive Assessment,Detectify - Stockholm Office,StockholmDistans,"
  What we do at Detectify 
   The fear of cyber threats should never stand in the way of digital greatness. That is why we are changing the fundamentals of how cyber security works. We collaborate with ethical hackers to build a powerful platform that automates and scales crowdsourced vulnerability research. 
   For us, security is not just about protecting what you have but more so a tool to achieve what you want. At Detectify, your opinion and ideas matter. You belong to a dedicated, driven and forever curious team that recognises the power of knowledge sharing and challenging the status quo. 
   We value diversity of minds, different backgrounds, and perspectives. We are all here because we want to make a positive impact in the world. If you are collaborative and passionate about what you do, then you too could be a Detectifyer. 
   The Predictive Assessment team 
   Our team is growing and we are looking for a Software Engineer to the Predictive Assessment team. This team is currently composed of four people that work hard in order to make sure that the members of Detectify Crowdsource - our network of white-hat hackers - are engaged and enjoying the best possible experience when collaborating with Detectify. 
   When a researcher submits a vulnerability through our Crowdsource platform, our team builds a module for it and adds it into the Detectify service. By reporting the vulnerability to us, it becomes a security test which is then made available to all our customers – this is how Detectify combines automation and crowdsourcing. 
   These tests come in various, unique flavors, and are driven by crowdsourced security knowledge. We in the Predictive Assessment team are responsible for validating, configuring and executing such tests on our customer's web applications. 
   We aim for the best possible scanning performance with comprehensive coverage of possible security issues optimizing for flow, fast feedback and quality. We follow lean and DevOps concepts, aiming to be innovative, helpful, and have a strong sense of ownership for all the things we build. 
   What you'll get to do 
   As a full stack software engineer in our team, you will help us provide a world class user experience for our customers by taking both our web application and security testing to the next level. As part of that, you will get to: 
   
   Use the latest technologies to solve real problems for our customers at a massive scale 
   Collaborate in a dynamic and empowered domain-driven environment to bridge software development and UX design 
   Experiment and learn fast to help us deliver cutting edge solutions for our customers 
   Share your knowledge and build creative solutions while helping the team make use of best practices 
   Be part of a great environment with awesome colleagues and world-class white hat hackers 
   
  Technologies you will get your hands on: 
   
   Modern development tools: React, GraphQL, Typescript, Golang and RabbitMQ 
   Event-based microservices architecture on AWS built using Kubernetes and Terraform 
   Various kinds of security testing: authentication bypass, cross-site scripting, DNS side channel attacks, etc. 
  
  Who you are 
   You come from a background where you are used to focusing on user behaviour as an important part of your delivery and you strive for simplicity and ease of use in your solutions. You love working in a collaborative environment bringing out the best of everyone within the team. 
   You like to set and achieve your own ambitious goals and solve complicated technical problems with a team full of creative problem solvers. You think it's meaningful to continuously evaluate and reflect on the team's solutions and think outside of the box to help the team solve hard problems with smart and simple solutions. 
   Typically you are used to working with SaaS products in a cloud first environment, running microservices at scale, having experience in building modern web applications relying on contemporary tools such as React and GraphQL. It is a bonus if you have an understanding of cyber security. 
   So, what do you think? 
   We are proud to foster an inclusive workplace free from discrimination. We strongly believe that diversity of experience, perspectives, and background will lead to a better environment for our employees and a better product. This is something we value deeply and we encourage everyone to be a part of changing the way the world thinks about security! Go hack yourself! 
   Remote work 
   This position is for the Stockholm office. We offer remote working, with access to our office in central Stockholm. We think you should be able to work from anywhere but for tax reasons we need you to be located in Sweden, and we are more than happy to help you relocate.

Software Engineer to Alva Labs,Alva,111 64 StockholmDistans,"Software Engineer to Alva Labs
There is something seriously broken with recruitment.
Candidates struggle to show who they are and instead spend time in tedious processes
Companies miss out on talent due to focusing on old fashioned success markers
Studies indicate that more than 40% of all hires are unsuccessful
Do you want to be part of the solution? Join Alva Labs and be part of building a product that reaches thousands of candidates daily.
The company
Alva Labs is a Stockholm-based SaaS company that offers a solution that is helping global companies scientifically grow their team. Alva has created a unique candidate assessment platform that helps companies build their organisations with the right people in the right place. By combining state-of-the-art psychometrics, data science, and an obsession with candidate experience, it provides the needed tool for data-driven talent acquisition.
We are growing 2-3x per year and are in the exciting phase to launch Alva in new markets. Our current focus is on building a great product, enabling Product-Lead-Growth, and releasing our next big bets.

The role
The team is currently divided into three different squads, but end of the year, we are looking to be six or seven squads. Each squad focuses on one product surface. You will work closely with other experienced engineers as well as designers, and product managers.
Within 1 month you will:
Have received the support you need in order to get a good start at Alva.
Start to familiarize yourself with the product and the system.
Started contributing to the squad’s work

Within 3 months you will:
Complete at least 1 ticket in each part of the tech stack.
Have helped your team build new features quicker than we otherwise would have - the velocity has increased significantly.

Within 6 months you will:
Impact the quality of the product, getting to the point where we fix all bugs and are improving performance metrics
Help introduce significant new features which radically improve our product.
Be proud of the product and the codebase

Our tech stack:
Python
React, JavaScript/TypeScript
Google Cloud Platform
Pub/Sub
PostgreSQL, Firestore
Kubernetes, Cloud Run
Protocol buffers
Event-driven microservices
The tech stack is described in more detail HERE.
You
Your background isn’t super important to us, we are more interested in who you are. Ideally, you have worked with building distributed systems before. More importantly, you:


Love solving complex problems and turn them into solutions that breathe simplicity
Are ambitious and structured
Are a prestigeless team player

The internal language is English, so no need to speak Swedish.


Your future colleagues
We are a team of 60+ people, representing 16 different nationalities and a wide selection of professional backgrounds. And all of that is absolutely fantastic, but the true beauty is the trust and warmth you will experience. You will most likely never be as supported and have so many brilliant minds to learn from and ask for guidance. To quote our CEO during our last company trip, “It feels like hanging out with a bunch of old friends”.
We currently have a hybrid approach, so working from home or at the office, is your choice.
If you want to creep out on this (perhaps your future) team, fire away!
Why join Alva?
The problem we are solving is not just engaging and interesting (the combination of psychological science and statistics, with a large chunk of candidate experience obsession, what’s not to love?!), but it is also something that has a tremendous impact on both people and businesses. You will have the opportunity to work with something that truly makes a difference.
With 250+ customers, strong growth, happy users, and 200 000+ assessed candidates, an NPS of 48, and a CSAT of +80, there is a lot of greatness to build from.
Besides, we have flexible work hours, where you can decide for yourself what works best for you. You will get 7 weeks of vacation, an on-market salary, a generous preventive care benefit, and a few other neat perks. You can read all about our benefits HERE and our company values HERE.

The hiring process
Given that we claim to be experts in hiring, you probably wonder what we have in store for you.

Objective screening with Alva’s own tests
First interview (focusing on who you are)

Technical interview
Done deal!


Come help us change the world of hiring!

   Jobbeskrivning 
   För två år sedan bildade vi en arkitektgruppering inom affärsområde IT Solutions, då vi såg ett behov av att kunna ge stöd och rådgivning till våra kunder inom olika områden gällande IT arkitektur. Denna gruppering har vuxit och dess spridning ökat såväl internt som externt och mycket spännande sker fortsatt under första halvan av 2022, inte minst med division AFRY X. 
   Arkitekterna är del av vår “Project delivery organization”, där vi är specialiserad på kund- och produktprojekt. Vi arbetar in house med fullt ansvar för leveransen och ser varje projekt som ett Start up där vi skräddarsyr vilka verktyg och tekniker som används beroende på typ av kund.

Är du systemutvecklare och sugen på att jobba full-stack nära både produkt & produktion i ett globalt sammanhang?
 Vi erbjuder dig

Vårt utvecklarteam består idag av fyra personer. Teamet ansvarar för utveckling, förvaltning och support av affärs- och produktionssystemet Vbas. Arkitektur, design, teknikval och testning görs i nära samarbete med beställaren. Vbas är utvecklat i Microsoftmiljö, C#.NET, VB.NET och MS SQL Server. Systemet innehåller moduler inom många områden från order till produktion, logistik och avsändning med automation i fokus. Just nu fokuserar vi på utökad digitalisering av verksamheten samt uppgradering av moduler utvecklade i äldre tekniker.

Som systemutvecklare hos oss ansvarar du för både front-end och back-end, dvs utveckling, förvaltning och support av Vbas. Då systemet är djupt integrerat i verksamheten kommer du vara en viktig partner i både produkt- och verksamhetsutveckling. Du får möjlighet att påverka utformningen av lösningarna, då du är med i hela utvecklingskedjan från projekt och specifikationer till förvaltning.

På FläktGroup hyllar vi därför mångfald eftersom vi är övertygade om att du behöver vara dig själv för att kunna göra skillnad.

Vi söker dig

Vi vill jobba med dig som är teamfokuserad, ser helheten och verkligen uppskattar problemlösning. Det här är en roll där prioriteringar och struktur är viktigt för att lyckas. Därför är det viktigt att du är duktig på att planera och jobba metodiskt.

Du har några års erfarenhet inom systemutveckling i Microsoft .NET (C#, VB) samt databasutveckling inom MS SQL Server. Gärna med en högskoleutbildning inom IT/systemvetenskap i grunden samt en förståelse för logistik, konfiguratorer, integrationer och databaser. Det är bra om du även är bevandrad i utveckling av affärssystem och produktnära system inom en producerande verksamhet. Har du erfarenhet av utveckling av appar för mobila plattformar är det ett plus.

Då vi är en global organisation med engelska som koncernspråk behöver både din engelska och svenska vara god. Vi jobbar agilt på vår IT-funktion så har du tidigare koll på agila metoder såsom scrum eller kanban är det toppen.

 Välkommen med din ansökan redan idag!

Kulturen är vår största fördel och den känns varje gång vi möts. Hos oss känner man sig som en del av något bra och har stor möjlighet att påverka tillvaron.
På XLENT är alla konsulter som vill göra skillnad, något vi är väldigt stolta över. För att trivas i den rollen så behöver vi vara kunniga och engagerade, men också ha förmågan att möta människor, se större sammanhang och leda sig själv.

De flesta av oss har en grundkompetens som matchar våra uppdrag och erbjudanden inom IT-infrastruktur eller systemutveckling. Vi säger att våra nyckelkompetenser är konsultmannaskap, affärsmannaskap, kulturmannaskap och hybridmannaskap. Det viktiga för oss är framförallt att hitta personer som passar och trivs hos oss. Specifik kompetens kan rätt person alltid lära sig.
Är du pusselbiten vi söker?
Vi har behov av dig som har några års erfarenhet av utveckling, både inom front- och backend. Du har nog ett analytiskt sinne och triggas av att lära dig nya saker. Vi jobbar mycket med .NET och React, så har du erfarenhet av det senaste som händer inom dessa områden är det ett plus. En skarp förmåga att lösa problem och ett driv att ständigt lära sig nya saker är däremot viktigare än att du kan ett specifikt språk eller ramverk.
Vi är också öppna för att få in andra perspektiv och synsätt som kan bredda vårt erbjudande. Kanske är du en fena på Python eller erfaren inom AI/ML? XLENT strävar alltid efter att erbjuda våra kollegor utmanande och roliga uppdrag – helst i någon form av teamleverans där vi får jobba ihop.
En relevant examen är ett bra kvitto på att du är en vetgirig person som slutför dina åtaganden, men det är inte nödvändigt om du kan visa på andra likvärdiga meriter.

     Hackberry söker sin nästa systemutvecklare! Vill du ha flexibilitet och ansvar, jobba med både riktigt små kunder och stora etablerade företag? 
      Vi är ett expanderande konsultbolag som jobbar med Appar och Analytics men även en hel del däremellan. Just nu vill vi utöka vårt team inom Systemutveckling och söker därmed breda backend- och/eller fullstackprofiler. Vi är en flexibel arbetsgivare och vi erbjuder alla våra anställda en del valmöjligheter som t.ex flexibla arbetstimmar & flexibel arbetsplats. Vårt kontor är beläget i The Factory i Sollentuna, och du väljer själv om du vill arbeta full-time on site, eller om du vill jobba hemifrån några dagar i veckan. 
     Vad vi gör 
      Vi bygger appar, analyslösningar och system för våra kunder! Internt eller på plats hos kund, stora projekt och små, i team eller individuellt, stora etablerade företag eller nya startups. Vi är ett fullservice företag, och kan hantera alla delar av kedjan från idé till koncept, design, UX/UI, utveckling, integration, test, support och förvaltning. 
     Vad du får 
      Vi bygger ett bolag som vill jobba på själva. Det innebär en massa saker, men i korthet en fast bra lön med alla förmåner på plats. Vi är ett företag som låter dig fokusera på vad du gör bäst utan att sätta käppar i hjulen på livspusslet. Du får öppenhet, flexibilitet & en schysst arbetsgivare. 
     Eftersom vi är ett ungt bolag (grundat 2019) så bygger vi fortfarande bolaget. Detta innebär att du som anställd får vara med och påverka Hackberrys framtid och vart vi är påväg. Vi bygger alltså bolaget tillsammans, och ett bolag som vi själva vill jobba på. 
     Idag är vi 15 personer och vi söker ytterligare några utvecklare som både vill vara med på resan framåt, och som vill påverka vart det hela tar vägen.
    
   
  
 
  
   
    
     Kvalifikationer 
     Rätt person är av absolut vikt för oss, dvs DU. Vi anställer människor, inte CV:s och vi är lika intresserad av vad du kan lära dig som av vad du faktiskt redan kan. 
     Du bör vara mångsidig och flexibel, bekväm i en platt och föränderlig verksamhet. Med det sagt, vi är konsulter - så det är av största vikt att du gillar att hantera kundkontakter och kan ta dig an nya projekt och miljöer snabbt. 
     Alla här skriver under på våra valda ledord: Care, Share, Enjoy & Grow. Rimligen tycker du att det är spännande att vara med och bygga upp något, och troligen bor du norr om stan (som nästan alla vi gör, dock har det smugit sig in någon enstaka Stockholmsbo). 
     Vi ser gärna att du: 
     
      Har minst 4 års erfarenhet av systemutveckling (Fullstack eller Backend; Java, Kotlin, React, NodeJS, Python, Cloud & DevOps är alla bra kompetenser och av intresse). 
      Talar och skriver obehindrat på svenska 
      Ser positivt på att arbeta som konsult och möjligheten att få lära dig olika branscher 
      Tycker det är spännande att arbeta i ett mindre, men expansivt bolag, där du får vara med och påverka Hackberry. 
      
     Som person är du: 
     
      Flexibel 
      Ansvarstagande 
      Kreativ

Systemutvecklare - 80% till projekt & 20% till personlig...,Edument,252 20 HelsingborgDistans,"
  Nu söker vi dig som redan arbetar som systemutvecklare men är trött på att jobba med samma kod dag ut och dag in. Vi ser att du tillsammans med oss vill fortsätta utvecklas i din roll som utvecklare genom arbete med olika kunder och i olika projekt. 
  Vilket programmeringsspråk du jobbar i varierar beroende på projekt, och vi värdesätter din förmåga att tackla olika sorters problem. Vi ser även gärna att din erfarenhet från tidigare projekt gör att du vet vilka lösningar som lämpar sig bäst. 
  Du kommer varva arbete ute hos kund, med framtida möjlighet att vara en del av inhouse-projekt med kollegor. Du kommer vara med i vår spännande tillväxtfas och bli kollega med andra duktiga systemutvecklare.  
  
  Vem är du? 
   Vi söker dig som bidrar med dina kunskaper och erfarenheter, kommer med nya idéer och gärna bollar lösningar inom teamet. Vårt mål är inte att stoppa dig i ett fack, utan att vi tillsammans formar din väg på Edument.
   För att vi ska bli en bra match tror vi att du kan identifiera dig med nedan: 
  
   Du bör ha ett par års arbetslivserfarenhet och har arbetat i olika mjukvaruprojekt, erfarenhet av konsultbranschen är meriterande. 
   Meriterande är om du arbetet med GIT, containers, microservices och/eller cloud-lösningar.
   Det må låta som en klyscha; men vår mentalitet som Edumentare är att vi är nyfikna, söker ständigt ny kunskap och delar prestigelöst med oss av det vi kan. 
  
   
  Att vara Edumentare
   På Edument går vi vår egen väg och tror på individerna i företaget. Vår kompetens och strävan efter ny kunskap är det som utmärker oss. Som del i vårt tech-team kommer du få möjlighet och tid till personliga utveckling. 
  Vår filosofi är att vi (över tid) lägger 80% i projekt mot kund, och 20% på kompetensutveckling, för att utveckla dig och Edument. Vi investerar i att du, under arbetstid, ska utvecklas för att nå dit du vill. Det kan innebära nyttjande av din kompetensbudget, lägga tid på att lära dig nya tekniker eller jobba i projekt som på sikt ger oss värde.
  
   För oss är även gemenskap viktigt, det skapar hållbara team och gör det roligare att gå till jobbet! Därför strävar vi mot att en gång i månaden göra aktiviteter där vi har kul tillsammans utanför kontoret. Senaste året har vi bl.a. spelat paintball, curling och drejat. 
  Tillsammans skapar vi möjligheter för varandra och för Edument och utvecklar både varandra och andra. Internt uppmuntrar vi till TechTalks och workshops, för att både få inspiration och lära oss nya saker. Externt delar vi med oss av webinar/event och egenskrivna blogginlägg. 
  Edument investerar i människor, utveckling och innovation. Genom våra tre affärsområden fokuserar vi idag på systemutveckling, utbildning och startups genom Edventure Tech - men vem vet vad vi gör om fem år?

Vår filosofi är att bygga team som är tillräckligt små att varje teammedlem kan ha överblick och känna ansvar för hela stacken men tillräckligt stora för att kunna avlasta varandra inom teamet.

   Vem du är
   Vi söker speciellt dig som är nyfiken på att kontinuerligt bredda din kompetens och hitta nya tekniska lösningar. Eftersom vi fortfarande är ett relativt litet bolag finns alltid tillfälle att testa egna idéer! För detta krävs ett visst mått av självgående och driv, vilket vi ser är meriterande att kunna visa i en intervjuprocess.
   Med det sagt jobbar vi förstås främst tillsammans när vi löser problem. Alla utvecklare har en mentor som de kan använda för att bolla allt från karriär och tech till personliga funderingar och vi ser gärna att mer juniora utvecklare söker denna roll!
   Utöver rena tekniska kvalifikationer värdesätter vi intresse för börsen och investeringar högt. Vi märker helt enkelt att jobbet blir både bättre och roligare ju mer domänkunskap våra anställda har, även på utvecklingsavdelningen.
   Andra meriterande erfarenheter:

Och som ett techbolag som sysslar med spel kommer ett ansvar, både för folks drömmar och spänning, men även för deras spelande.

Att arbeta med teamets åtagande oavsett arbetsuppgift är nyckeln för att teamet ska få ett bra flöde, exempelvis genom att stötta i analysarbete eller testaktiviteter vid behov.

    Det är viktigt att du är en prestigelös lagspelare som tycker om att samarbeta med andra och som alltid sätter laget framför jaget. Du drivs av att hitta lösningar på dina utmaningar, samtidigt som du har en helhetssyn och kan se ett större och längre perspektiv med ditt arbete. Du är även en nytänkande och kreativ person som inte är rädd för att utmana befintliga lösningar eller angreppssätt. 
     
     Det är även viktigt att du har: 
     
    
     Akademisk utbildning inom it eller motsvarande arbetslivserfarenhet som vi bedömer som likvärdig. 
     Erfarenhet av att arbeta inom hela det agila teamets åtagande och bidra utanför rollen som systemutvecklare (exempelvis genom att stötta i analysarbete eller testaktiviteter, vid behov). 
     Erfarenhet av systemutveckling inom back-end området. 
     Praktiskt tillämpat agila arbetssätt (exempelvis SAFe, Scrum eller Kanban)

| Vad kan du förvänta dig av TMC?

Genom Employeneurship-modellen är TMC unika. Det är affärsmodellen för 2000-talets ingenjörer och den bygger på fem pelare:

A LONG TERM WORKING RELATIONSHIP

På TMC kombinerar du säkerheten av en trygg anställning med de möjligheter som entreprenörskap erbjuder. Detta eliminerar osäkerheten man kan uppleva som konsult eller entreprenör och du får mer tid och energi till att fokusera på ditt arbete och dina långsiktiga ambitioner och mål.

INDIVIDUAL PROFIT SHARING

Employeneurship-modellen erbjuder en marknadsmässig grundlön samtidigt som dina entreprenöriella förmågor premieras och du tar del av vinsten. Du som Employeneur har möjlighet att själv påverka säljprocessen utifrån din kompetens och vi är transparenta när det kommer till både din omsättning och dina kostnader. Känn ditt marknadsvärde och dela vinsten som ditt arbete genererar!

BUSINESS CELLS
Som Employeneur tillhör du en Business Cell baserat på ditt tekniska kompetensområde. Dessa specialistområden utgår från teknologiska nischkompetenser och skapar nätverk mellan dig och andra Employeneurer med liknande bakgrund. Du som Employeneur blir del av ett starkt och relevant internationellt nätverk som möjliggör ett delat engagemang i kombination med kunskaps- och erfarenhetsutbyte.

YOUNIVERSITY
TMC värderar dig som Employeneur högt och har utvecklat ett program för att garantera din personliga och professionella utveckling, din YOUrney. YOUniversity är ett unikt program för din utveckling och är tänkt att stödja dig genom din karriär.

| Varför Employeneurship?
Uttrycket Employeneurship kanske låter obekant, det beror på att vi uppfann det. Inte bara som ett ord utan som ett sätt att arbeta, eller till och med ett paradigm. Att vara Employeneur är mycket mer än att bara arbeta som teknisk konsult. Denna unika roll ger dig möjlighet att tänka och agera som en entreprenör i kombination med den trygghet en anställning ger. Viktigast av allt - du får en garanti för ständig utveckling och möjligheten att vara fullt ansvarig för din egen karriär.

Talangprogrammet Tech,Valtech,Stockholm,"Valtechs talangprogram är en fantastisk möjlighet för dig som vill börja jobba med digitala lösningar utifrån ett tekniskt perspektiv.
När du blir antagen till talangprogrammet så blir du också anställd på Valtech och har lön från dag ett. Genom att gå talangprogrammet får du en gedigen utbildning som skapar en naturlig brygga mellan studier och arbetsliv.
Talangprogrammet är 3 månader långt och genomförs huvudsakligen från vårt kontor i Stockholm, nytt för 2022 är att det finns ett par hybridplatser för deltagare från Göteborg. Du genomför ca 50% av tiden i Stockholm och i övrigt sker programmet remote från Göteborgskontoret. Valtech står för resor och logi.

Fokus på teknik

Under den första perioden av programmet får du som talang 100% utbildning. Under utbildningen går du från labbuppgifter till kod som finns ”på riktigt”. Tempot är högt, men det är för att vi vill hinna ge dig en så bra grund som möjligt. Utbildningen sker genom labbar, föreläsningar och projektarbete. Det största momentet är projektarbetet, där du får arbeta med ett riktigt projekt, med beställare, stödresurser i form av strateger och designkompetenser från övriga Valtechare. Projektet bedrivs parallellt med annan utbildning under hela den första perioden.
Här är några exempel på vad vi går igenom:

React
TypeScript
CSS
C#
MVC (model view controller)
Node.js
GIT
TDD/BDD (testdriven utveckling resp beteendedriven utveckling)
Byggservrar (Jenkins)
GraphQL
Datadrivet arbetssätt
Funktionell programmering
Tillgänglighet
DevOps

Hur går antagningen till?
Antagningsprocessen består av två moment – en caseuppgift och en intervju. Caseuppgifterna handlar om grundläggande programmering och problemlösning. Uppgifterna liknar uppgifter som du har löst under din utbildning på universitetet. Du behöver därför inte förbereda dig på något särskilt sätt. Kom ihåg att det viktiga är hur du resonerar kring dina lösningar.

Tech Lead,Humblebee,411 05 GöteborgDistans,"Are you ready to work at Sweden's outstanding digital product & service company?
Why not join a workplace that gives you freedom, inspiration, incredible colleagues and a chance to work the way you want with projects you'll love.
Maybe you saw this article on Medium and thought it sounded exactly like the place you'd like to spend your days?
What we’re looking for
Our team of developers and architects is growing and we're looking for a new Tech Lead to join our team. You will be working closely with our Tech Director Johan and Tech Lead Tobias in managing the development team at Humblebee.
Maybe you're a Senior Developer who enjoys mentoring and coaching other developers? Maybe you've already worked as a Technical Lead or Technical Manager for a while and you're looking for a change of scenery? Either way we have interesting challenges and plenty of opportunities for you to grow and learn.
Our way of working
Our work is driven by the user experience. We extend this notion to technical architecture and solutions by being informed by domain-driven design, meaning our software should reflect the client’s business and not be just a technical-jargon construct. We prefer micro-services rather than monoliths and love the cloud and the possibilities it gives for creating performant, reliable and secure applications that scale over time.
What we expect from you
As a Tech Lead at Humblebee you'll be managing a team of developers. This mean you will be conducting salary and performance reviews, as well as driving team performance by coaching and supporting developers and architects. In this role you will also play a key part in hiring and resource allocation for the development team.
Since this isn’t just any team lead role, but a Tech Lead, you will play a key role in the development of our tech stack, tools and working methods. Our core stack is Javascript based and the frameworks we use are React and node.js so you should have a strong foundation in that stack. You will become one of the “go to people” for software development best practice questions.
In addition to managing the team, all our leads also work on client assignments as part of a cross functional product team. Most of the time that means you will be responsible for setting the architecture and/or managing the product team.
You are as important as your skills

Vi är ett litet konsultbolag som jobbar med apputveckling primärt. Vi har ganska nyligen tagit över bolaget själva och bygger vidare på det vi byggt upp senaste året. Ett bolag som vi själva vi jobba på kort och gott!
Idag är vi 10 personer och söker ytterligare några utvecklare som både vill vara med på resan framåt, och som vill påverka vart det hela tar vägen.
Vad vi gör

Vi bygger appar för våra kunder! Internt eller på plats hos kund, stora projekt och små, i team eller individuellt, stora etablerade företag eller nya startups. Allt går och allt gör vi. Vi är ett fullservice företag, och kan hantera alla delar av kedjan från idé till koncept, design, UX/UI, utveckling, integration, test, support och förvaltning.

Du bör vara mångsidig och flexibel, bekväm i en platt och föränderlig verksamhet. Med det sagt, vi är konsulter så det är av största vikt att du gillar och hanterar kundkontakter och kan ta dig an nya projekt och miljöer snabbt.
Vi bygger både Native iOS & Android men också cross-plattform i Flutter samt React Native. För den här rollen ska man såklart ha god erfarenhet av Flutter.
Vi värdesätter att du har en bred teknisk bakgrund, erfarenhet från AWS, GCP eller Azure är starkt meriterande. Har du jobbat som konsult tidigare är det bra, men inte ett måste.

Tech Lead Front End Development,Skymill,MalmöDistans,"“The piano aint got no wrong notes” Thellonius Monk
Mr Monk is considered to be one of the most prominent and original jazz composers ever. He was an outstanding piano player who had a habit of, in the middle of a song, simply stop playing, stand up and start to dance, completely engulfed in what the other musicians were playing. After a while he would sit down back at the piano and continue to play and lead the band.
That is the type of leader that we are looking for right now in our front-end department. Someone who is known for eyebrow raising original creations and has the passion for development that makes you simply have to stop what you are doing from time to time to be engulfed in and enjoy what your team is doing. And someone who can recognize that the team “aint got no wrong players”.
Further traits that we are looking for, for this position:
You don't give up when faced with problems that seem impossible to untangle
You have spent most of your life working with software development and engineering and consider yourself fluent in multiple programing languages & platforms

You don't give up on your own ideas, even if others find them weird or too far out

You enjoy giving lectures and talks, both inside and outside the office

You are living in, or plan to relocate to, the greater copenhagen region
If the description above sounds somewhat like you, we urge you to send in your application.
What you will be doing
Playing for Skymill as a Tech Lead in Front End Development means that you will be involved in a few projects at the same time and have full responsibility and freedom when working with our clients, helping them create and maintain quality software. You will be doing this either by working at our clients location, adapting to the clients processes and requirements, or by creating your own requirements and processes working from our office in Malmö. You also need to have the ability to turn these requirements and processes into beautiful implementations. You also have to walk and support your team members and your customer through the entire development cycle, including presales and arranging workshops.
Most of all, you have to let the passion you have for producing quality software shine through in your everyday work. You will be working alongside some of the most brilliant developers on the scene at the moment, so you have to be able to let them shine as brightly as you do

Desired skills
To be able to fill the bill as Tech Lead for front end development, we believe that you have at least five years of real work life experience from the field, and you have to be at an expert level within one or many of the following areas or technologies:
JavaScript

Typescript

Node.js

React, Vue, Angular

UI/UX design

API Development

Test driven development

Cloud first development practices
In addition, we take for granted that you possess sufficient day-to-day knowledge of:
Relational and NoSQL databases

Version control in Git

CI/CD work flows

AWS and/or GCP

Open source methodologies
As tech lead, you also need the skills to guide, train and motivate your more junior team members and colleagues towards getting the same quality in their work as you get in yours. Occasionally, you are expected to attend software development events and host public sessions and workshops around your expertise. And of course, you have to be comfortable in the role of a consultant.
.
Our offer to you
Apart from working with one of the fastest growing, most flexible companies in the region, you will get a competitive salary and pension package, as well as 30 days paid vacation. Our different bonus systems is another perk that we think you will appreciate.
You will be working alongside lots of smart and talented developers, cloud architects and project managers with extensive experience from the industry, each being a master of their own instrument. Knowledge transfer and information sharing are some of our strongest bywords and we try to live up to this by making sure we get together at least once a week for cross reference groups, q&a´s and brainstorming sessions.
We also offer an extensive training and educational program to make sure that your competence and your skills are constantly kept at top level.
Outside the office we have recurring “jam-sessions” where having fun is the main objective. We often hang out at the office for a beer or two after work, keeping the fridge full at all times. So if you wanna give it a shot, send us your application!

Tech lead till Virtuellt kontor,Decerno,Sverige,"
  Tycker du om att jobba i React, Angular eller Typescript? Är det dags att ta nästa kliv i karriären? Då borde du läsa vidare. 
   Vi söker nämligen vår nästa tech lead med tyngdpunkt i frontendutveckling till vårt härliga gäng! Är du en person som tycker det är viktigt med respektfull kommunikation, vågar utforska och pröva samt gillar att skapa värde tillsammans? Då delar du våra värderingar. På Decerno arbetar vi tillsammans för att skapa värde i allt vi gör, både för våra anställda och för våra kunder. Det är något som är med oss i hela processen från början till slut och är en självklarhet i vår vardag. 
   Våra uppdrag – bidra till samhällsnytta 
   Vår nisch är att bygga skräddarsydda digitala lösningar som skapar nya möjligheter, förenklar livet för människor och stärker våra kunders konkurrenskraft - allt utifrån vår kunds specifika behov. Vi riktar in oss på uppdrag där vi tar ett helhetsansvar över projektets framgång och kan bemanna med ett helt team av våra egna anställda. Vi söker nära och långa samarbeten med kund där vi bygger långsiktigt hållbara lösningar. 
   Det som driver Decerno är att göra skillnad. För oss är det viktigt att vi kan bidra till en bättre värld och ett bättre samhälle. Därför har vi en stark etisk policy som guidar oss i våra val av projekt. Vi väljer aktivt bort projekt inom vapenindustrin och med koppling till alkohol, tobak eller spel om pengar. Dessutom siktar vi på att kunna koppla fler av våra projekt till FN:s globala hållbarhetsmål. 
   Rollen 
   Rollen vi söker är en Tech lead till vårt Volvo cars-team. Teamet och leveransen är just nu i en etableringsfas, vilket öppnar upp för en varierande vardag som kan omfatta (men inte begränsas till): 
   
   Utveckling, främst i React, Vue och Typescript 
   Delta i workshops och möten med stakeholders 
   Initiera och implementera konkurrenskraftiga lösningar för produkten 
   
  Vi tror på att kunna erbjuda våra medarbetare en stor flexibilitet och anser därför att valmöjligheten att kunna sitta heltid på distans ska vara en självklarhet. Vårt Virtuella kontor är vårt sätt att erbjuda dig möjligheten att välja din arbetsplats själv. Om den är i sommarstugan vid sjön eller fjällstugan i skogen spelar oss ingen roll – du är en del av vårt team ändå, där du får ingå i ett befintligt team i något av våra pågående projekt. 
   Är det här du? 
   I rollen som tech lead ser vi gärna att du tar med dig en del tidigare erfarenheter. Därför önskar vi att du har ungefär 4 års tidigare erfarenhet av frontendutveckling, gärna i React/Vue.js eller Typescript. Det ses som meriterande (men inte absolut nödvändigt) om du tidigare har arbetat med Azure, azure devops, integrationer, .net web api eller CSS. En högskoleutbildning väger såklart också tungt, men tidigare erfarenhet som motsvarar utbildningen funkar också. 
   Som person tycker du om att kommunicera enkelt, rakt och ärligt med dina kollegor på såväl svenska som engelska i tal och skrift. Du trivs med att jobba i ett team med stark ”tillsammans” känsla och blir gärna en ”doer” under de tekniska diskussionerna tillsammans med ditt team. Under arbetets gång tar du dig tid och förstår vad kunden är ute efter och kan sedan översätta det till användarvänliga lösningar för slutanvändaren. 
   Varför du ska välja Decerno 
   I våra medarbetarundersökningar blir det gång på gång tydligt att det är de fantastiska kollegorna, de roliga och utmanande projekten och möjligheten att kunna bidra till samhällsnytta som gör att vi trivs så bra på Decerno. 
   Sedan finns det också några ytterligare aspekter som vi som arbetsgivare ser som självklarheter: 
   
   En flexibel arbetsplats med större frihet att planera vardagen för att få arbete och privatliv att gå ihop 
   Vi erbjuder extra föräldraförmåner för vi tycker att familjen är viktigast 
   Vi tycker att din kompetensutveckling är viktig! Därför anordnar vi interna utbildningar i vår egen Dec Academy och håller årliga konferenser 
   Vi vill att du ska må bra, trivas och ha roligt på arbetet och därför arrangerar vi regelbundet olika sociala aktiviteter, utmaningar och hälsotävlingar – såväl virtuellt som på plats (i vanliga fall) 
   
  Utöver detta erbjuder vi även ett brett förmånspaket som inkluderar bland annat friskvårdsbidrag och försäkringspaket. Vi berättar gärna mer om du vill veta vad mer vi på Decerno skulle kunna erbjuda dig. 
   Låter detta som ditt nästa steg i karriären? 
   Bra, då vill vi ha in din ansökan så snart som möjligt! 
   Vi välkomnar en mångfald av sökande med olika bakgrund och ser fram emot att få veta mer om dig och hur vi kan bli en del av ditt nästa steg i karriären. 
   På Decerno är vi ca 130 anställda fördelade på mellan vårt virtuella kontor och våra fysiska kontor i Stockholm, Uppsala, Göteborg, Malmö och Sevilla, Spanien. Vi är måna om vår familjära känsla av ett mindre bolag samtidigt som vi sedan 2010 har haft tryggheten av att vara en del av Addnode Group.

Du är van vid agila arbetssätt, så som Scrum & Kanban - eller kanske en kombination av båda?
Varje team äger sin domän och ansvarar för de mikrotjänster som agerar inom den. Vår teknikstack består till största delen av Java och Kotlin som körs på Spring Boot och Docker, våra webappar baseras oftast på React och TypeScript. Saknar du att arbeta med några av våra tekniker eller har du kunskaper inom andra språk eller teknikstack så är det inga problem, vi lär dig gärna och vill att du ska utvecklas hos oss!
Du får titeln ”Fullstack Developer”, men vi vet att ingen är expert på allt. Det vi menar är att man är en utvecklare som känner sig trygg inom backend eller frontend, men samtidigt är nyfiken och vill lära sig mer där man känner sig mindre trygg. Att arbeta som ”Fullstack Developer” tror vi är en fantastisk möjlighet för att utvecklas i yrkesrollen. Vi kommer att uppmuntra dig att gå utanför din komfortzon och pröva nya teknologier. Att växa som utvecklare ingår i vårt dagliga arbete, men även under mer kreativa former med Hackdays och Devjams.

   Vad DU kommer göra
   
   Spännande projekt: Vi arbetar med flera utmanande och roliga projekt. Projekten variera från små appar till att jobba med kundernas kärnsystem. Gemensamt för alla projekten är att de gör stor skillnad för våra kunder och dess användare. 
   Modern teknik: Vi arbetar med att bygga fullskaliga applikationer så att du får möjlighet att göra skapa spännande saker i frontend hela vägen tillbaka till infrastruktur och oftast i molnet. 
   Gemenskap: Vi trivs att jobba tillsammans och tar ett gemensamt ansvar för våra lösningar. Genom att dela med sig av vår kunskap och vi växer som människor tillsammans, men framför allt tycker vi om att ha roligt tillsammans.
  
   
   Vad vi kan erbjuda dig
   Riktade mål: Våra anställda är det som gör oss speciella och att hålla dig lycklig och tekniskt utmanad är det som driver oss framåt. Några saker vi erbjuder för att uppnå detta är utbildning i ny teknik, möten med vår karriärcoach och de bästa verktygen för att skriva kod.
   Transparens: GESHDO grundades av två utvecklare som hämtar kärnvärdena från sina egna omfattande erfarenheter som konsulter. En viktig sak för oss är att vi är öppna. Ingenting är hemligt och den som vill vara en del av beslutsprocessen är välkommen.
   Social miljö: Balansen mellan arbete och privatliv är nyckeln för oss. Möten sker under arbetstid och övertid är något vi alltid försöker undvika.

   ”GESHDO-filosofin”: Vi utmanar branschen att göra användarupplevelsen till primärt fokus. Utveckling bör inte ha bekvämlighet som sin primära drivkraft, att utmana sig själv att använda ny teknik, använda nya sätt att tänka och testa gränserna för vad som är möjligt bör ses som ett sätt att bygga bästa möjliga lösningen snarare än att ses som en begränsning.
   Om detta passar med din värdegrund, så tror vi att vi kommer att ha det mycket kul när vi arbeta tillsammans!

Wrknest söker nu Fullstack-utvecklare samt Frontend-utvecklare till Fondo. Fondo är ett startup och har en bred bakgrund från finans och teknik. Vi letar efter dig som vill jobba i ett snabbrörligt företag där du har stort ansvar i det du levererar. Du kommer att arbeta nära produkten och komma in tidigt i företaget, vilket ger dig stora möjligheter att vara med och sätta din prägel.
Fondos stack är baserad på mikrotjänster i en Google Cloud-miljö, främst i Kubernetes, som tillsammans med frontend-applikationer utgör deras plattform. I backend finns flera REST API:er och integrationer mot tredjepartssystem. De har byggt upp sitt system och appen själva vilket gör att systemet är anpassningsbart och implementationer går snabbt. De använder JavaScript och TypeScript över hela stacken med hjälp av framförallt Node.js och React. De håller ett ständigt öga på allt spännande som händer inom området och är öppna för ny teknik och nya metoder.

Detta är en direktrekrytering via Wrknest med anställning hos Fondo och all kontakt sköts direkt med Wrknest för denna process.

Dina framtida arbetsuppgifter
Beroende på vilken inriktning och intresse du har kommer din roll att se lite olika ut. Om du är mer mot Frontend jobbar du antingen mer inriktat mot marknad, design och hemsidan med webbutveckling, eller mer i appen som är skriven i React Native, där man kommer sköta all typ av kodning kring den. Den ena rollen som Fullstack-utvecklare riktas mer mot app och den andra mer Backend kring deras interna och tredjepartssystem.


Hos Fondo kommer du att få möjlighet att utvecklas kunskapsmässigt och påverka teknikstacken, där det finns alla möjligheter för dig att växa i din roll och i företaget.

Vi tror att de flesta människor kan lära sig det mesta så länge de är nyfikna och har rätta viljan. Det vi vill se av dig är ett genuint intresse för utveckling och teknik och en förmåga att se lösningar i problem.

Om företaget
Fondo startades då de saknade en oberoende fondplattform där de kunde spara i sina favoritfonder och endast betala för tjänster de verkligen ville använda. Istället för att försöka runda finansiella regelverk tog de dessa till hjälp för att designa en plattform med så få inbyggda intressekonflikter som möjligt. Genom att använda teknik och infrastruktur från 2020-talet har de lyckats bygga bort en mängd fördyrande mellanhänder vilket möjliggör en helt ny prissättning. Fondo kan nu erbjuda bastjänster inom fondsparande helt utan plattformsavgift och istället fokusera på att ta fram funktioner som är värdeskapande för deras sparare.",https://se.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appsharedroid&jk=4250200a481e0f55

Varför du vill jobba på Brath?
Brath är ett Norrländskt företag, även om vi också finns på plats på Kungsgatan i Stockholm. Vi tror gärna att det betyder en lite annan miljö, lite mer norrländskt sansad kanske. Vi bryr oss dessutom om vår personal och du har säkert redan tidigare hört talas om byrån med 6 timmars arbetsdagar. Det är vi.
De kortare dagarna är inte anledningen att du ska söka, det är bara ett symptom på att vi faktiskt bryr oss om våra medarbetare på riktigt.
Vad är jobbet?
Vi ska göra en större satsning byggt på WordPress, det handlar om många stora och små installationer som behöver allt från teman till nya plugins. Som utvecklare förväntas du ta helhetsansvar för allt från att bygga dessa till att se till att driften fungerar. Du ska förstås inte springa i serverhallar och rota men se till att någon annan, på något annat företag, gör det.
Du kommer arbeta när vår senior-utvecklare Henrik som ansvarar för i princip allt i utvecklingsform på Brath. Vi ser gärna att du finns i Örnsköldsvik men Stockholm fungerar också bra.
Låter det intressant?

Vi söker fler utvecklare till Björn Lundén,Björn Lundén,820 64 NäsvikenDistans,"Om oss
Björn Lundén är ett kunskaps- och programvaruföretag som sedan mer än 30 år förenklar vardagen för små och medelstora företag. Främst genom att erbjuda moderna programlösningar, begriplig information och praktiska verktyg för att sköta företagets skatt och deklaration, redovisning, löner och personalfrågor.
Vi är idag drygt 100 medarbetare på kontoret i Näsviken och ett femtontal på Ljusdalskontoret. Senare i år kommer vi också ha ett kontor i Hudiksvall.

Vi jobbar i en organisation som präglas av delaktighet och samarbete. Som arbetsgivare är vår vision att vara det självklara valet för anställda och blivande anställda som vill må bra och ha kul på jobbet och som vill ha en arbetsplats som erbjuder trygghet, respekt, kompetens, ärlighet, kommunikation och delaktighet.
Ditt team
Vi växer som tusan och vill hela tiden göra en massa nya (helst coola) grejer, så vi behöver fler utvecklare av alla de slag. Frontend, backend, mobilt, vi har mycket som vi vill göra på samtliga områden. Utvecklingsavdelningen består idag av 25 personer fördelade i mindre team som ser lite olika ut beroende på vad vi för tillfället fokuserar på.
Som utvecklare på Björn Lundén arbetar du i ett väldigt självbestämmande team där teamet fördelar och specar arbetsuppgifterna tillsammans. Många projekt är fullstack, där du kan bli involverad i såväl backend som frontend, om det passar dig. Du arbetar nära ditt team och är med tidigt i processen och hela vägen till release (och vidare) för vi tror helt enkelt att det resulterar i bäst grejer. Är det något av det vi gör som intresserar dig extra mycket, brukar det finnas goda möjligheter att få arbeta med detta. Vi jobbar i Windows, Mac och Linux - du väljer det du föredrar.
Då många av oss (nåväl, vissa av oss i alla fall) också har ett liv som inte bara handlar om teknik och kod, utan också om t ex familj, fotboll eller hemslöjd så har vi rätt goda möjligheter att anpassa arbetsdagen efter hur livet ser ut. Vi arbetar efter agil metodik och ser tillsammans till att hålla våra kunskaper uppdaterade och relevanta. Det gör vi genom att avsätta tid för att förkovra oss i nya spännande tekniker, bygga sidoprojekt eller bara testa nya ramverk eller bibliotek. Vi utbildar gärna varandra om vi hittar något häftigt (eller användbart, men speciellt om det är något häftigt) så att vi alla kan utvecklas som grupp. Teamarbete är, som du kanske märker, viktigt för oss. Därför vill vi helst att du arbetar på plats på något av våra kontor (Näsviken, Ljusdal eller Hudiksvall) men med möjlighet till att arbeta remote vid behov.
Visst låter vi som ett hyfsat roligt gäng? Ibland lämnar vi till och med skrivborden och beger oss ut på after work och stänger någon av krogarna inne i stan.
Din profil
Du skulle aldrig få för dig att kalla dig ”kodninja”, ”rockstar” eller ”10x-developer”, men du är en skön typ som vill bygga tajta och snygga system med ett gäng inte-helt-osköna typer.
Om du har en 3D-skrivare, någon form av laser som egentligen är lite för stark för hemmabruk eller har byggt ett Raspberry Pi-kluster ”bara för att”, så kommer du att passa in bra. Om du saknar 3D-skrivare behöver du inte vara orolig, vi kan tipsa dig om ett bra modell.
Du har några (eller många) års erfarenhet av att jobba med Java, .Net, Javascript/Typescript, Angular eller React och du kan gissa dig till vilka av orden Tailwind, Jenkins, Kafka, Maven, Myrrh.js, REST och MySQL som beskriver teknik och vilket vi nyss hittade på. Du behöver självklart inte pricka in samtliga ovanstående punkter, ett par stycken räcker bra. Framför allt är du sugen på att lära dig (och oss) nya grejer i en miljö där det är ok att begå misstag och ställa ”dumma” frågor.
Hör av dig om du är intresserad så ser vi till att du får träffa våra trevligaste medarbetare!
I skrivande stund finns det inget som heter Myrrh.js, men eftersom vi inte har tid att uppdatera denna annons i samma takt som det ploppar upp nya Javascript frameworks kan detta mycket väl vara en kuggfråga.",https://se.indeed.com/viewjob?from=appsharedroid&jk=e48b3095f68addca
